"As Nepal undergoes rapid industrialisation and infrastructure expansion, the country’s diverse bird population face an emerging threat from electrocution and power line collisions. This issue is of growing concern among conservationists, who warn that the lives of endangered and vulnerable bird species are at stake. Nepal is renowned for its rich biodiversity accompanied by diverse landscapes, habitats, climates, wildlife and cultures. Because of this diversity, it has become a home to 915 species of birds including several that are critically endangered species (42) and the endemic species Spiny Babbler.  However, different anthropogenic factors are creating a cause for the increasing bird mortality; power lines being one of the most significant threats. In recent years, Nepal has expanded its electricity grid, with power lines and infrastructure crisscrossing the nation’s landscapes along with the increment in consumers by 7.76 per cent and peak demand by 13.66 per cent. Nepal Electricity Authority has set a goal to achieve 100 per cent electrification by the next two years and so several hydropower projects are under the development process. While this expansion is essential for economic growth and has improved the quality of life for many, it also has created hazards for birds. The increase in power lines across landscapes used by birds for migration, nesting, and feeding has led to a rise in electrocution and collisions. Birds that perch on or near power lines are at risk of electrocution when they make inadvertently contact with electrical conductors.  This can result in instant death or severe injury. Collisions occur when birds fly onto power lines, often due to low visibility or distractions. The impact can be fatal or cause significant harm, leading to a slow and painful death. Birds of large size mainly raptors are more prone to electrocution as compared to smaller ones because of their short wingspan. A study by Dr Subedi and his team recorded 54 electrocuted raptors belonging to 8 species. The most affected species were the Himalayan Buzzard, Mountain Hawk-eagle, Bearded Vulture, White-rumped Vulture and Common barn owl. Likewise, Hamal and his team recorded critically endangered White-rumped Vultures along with smaller birds like House Swift, Common Myna, Rock Dove, Blue Whistling-thrush and Crow species as victims of power lines.  A database on admitted raptors in the Wildlife Rescue Center of Kaski also showed that 56 per cent of total cases resulted in raptor mortality, electrocution being the major cause leading by 90 per cent. Raptors are observed nesting and roosting in the electricity pylons and using them as hunting perches in the absence of natural perches making them vulnerable to electrocution. Raptors are the indicators of ecosystem health are now facing threats to their populations by increasing power line incidents.   The mortality of 47 individuals of Sarus Crane resulted from electrocution and collisions in Greater Lumbini Area alone between 2010 and 2023 as recorded by Dr Sharma and his team. The farmlands and wetlands are the primary habitats used by Sarus Crane for roosting and breeding, however, the presence of power lines over these habitats increases the collision risks of the species due to their low flight. For gregarious species, the danger of electrocution escalates when multiple birds perch on pylons with unsafe designs. This is because they can simultaneously touch different phases or grounded parts of the structure, leading to phase-to-phase or phase-to-ground electrocution, potentially harming more than one bird at once.  The electrocution risk is lower for higher-voltage power structures as phase clearances are wider than the wingspans of birds. However, medium-voltage structures present a much higher risk due to the smaller insulators, specific structure designs, and the shorter distances between electrical phases and the structure itself. The collision risk is higher in bad weather conditions as heavy fog, rain, storms, snow and low light cause less visibility of the surroundings during flight. Multiple approaches may be applied through partnerships involving conservation organisations, governmental bodies, and electricity providers to mitigate bird electrocution and power line accidents in Nepal.  Introducing bird-friendly designs to power line structures, such as insulated wires, safer pole configurations, adequate spacing techniques, and adding perches that guide birds away from dangerous areas can reduce the risk of electrocution.  Marking power lines with bird diverters or reflective materials can increase visibility and reduce collisions. Continued monitoring of bird populations and incidents of electrocution and collisions will help identify high-risk areas and guide conservation efforts. Community involvement is crucial in addressing this issue. Local communities must be educated about the risks to birds, encouraged to report incidents of electrocution or collision to the relevant Division Forest Office and promote bird-friendly practices.  Power companies may start partnerships with conservation groups to develop and implement bird-safe infrastructure. Government should implement and promote bird-friendly power line construction and maintenance. By addressing bird electrocution and collision mitigating strategies, Nepal can work toward a future where its avian diversity remains protected, even as it continues to advance its energy infrastructure. As research and conservation efforts continue, the hope is that Nepal’s skies will become safer for its birds, ensuring that future generations can enjoy the vibrant and diverse avian life that is a hallmark of this beautiful nation.",,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/birds-on-electricity-wire-300x200.jpg,2024-05-06,Online Khabar EN,,Birds at risk: Power line threatens Nepal’s avian life,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/birds-at-risk-power-line-threatens-nepals-avian-life.html
"Raju Acharya, a Nepali conservationist, won the Whitley Award for his owl conservation efforts, marking the third consecutive win for Nepal.Acharya’s work focuses on challenging stereotypes and advocating for owl conservation in Nepal, despite facing societal stigmas and challenges.He plans to use the prize money of 50,000 pounds ($62,600) to enhance conservation initiatives in central Nepal, targeting law enforcement training and community engagement. KATHMANDU — Raju Acharya, a Nepali conservationist, has been named one of the six winners of this year’s prestigiousWhitley Awards, also known as the “Green Oscars” for grassroots conservation work, in recognition of his work protecting and campaigning for owls. Acharya, the third Nepali to win the award in as many years, is the founder and executive director of Friends of Nature, a Kathmandu-based NGO. The resident of Pokhara, a town in western Nepal, has campaigned for the conservation of the birds of prey for more than 15 years, despite facing numerous challenges, such as stereotypes of local people toward the raptors and their conservation. “In my society [the] owl is seen as a lazy and dull creature; when you advocate for their conservation, you are labeled the same way,” Acharya said, addressing the award ceremony. “When I was chosen to represent the World Owl Trust in Nepal, I received ironic congratulations from those around me. Despite the discouragement, I was determined to learn about owls,” said Acharya, also the brains behind the annual Owl Festival, one of the largest conservation events in Nepal. According to the Whitley Fund for Nature, the U.K. nonprofit that administers the annual award, Acharya will use the prize money of 50,000 pounds ($62,600) to boost initiatives in central Nepal, home to 19 of the country’s 23 owl species. Acharya’s plan is to conduct training to increase the capacity of law enforcement agencies, policymakers and “owl envoys” (local ambassadors for the owls) with the objective of reducing the volume of hunting and trade by a quarter. In an interview with Mongabay in August 2023, Acharya said that although owls face multiple threats such as hunting, illegal trade, habitat loss and electrocution, there isn’t sufficient scientific data to justify their classification as “threatened.” “This creates a vicious cycle of low conservation priority,” he added. Acharya, who played a crucial role in the formulation of the Owl Conservation Action Plan in 2020 to address the threats to owls from hunting, illegal trade and habitat loss, had told Mongabay that although it took around a year to prepare the plan, there wasn’t adequate budget to implement it. “Nepali conservation officials are still reluctant to consider owls as wild animals,” he said. Another Nepali conservationist, Tulshi Laxmi Suwal, who works on pangolin conservation, won aWhitley Award in 2023. Similarly, Sonam Tashi Lama, who works on red panda (Ailurus fulgens) conservation, was aWhitley Award winner in 2022. Prominent Nepali ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral also won the award for his community-based bird conservation project in 2005.

"Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), governments, and corporations across 160 countries consider or approve more than one investment per day in the energy sector.Despite commitments to tackle the climate crisis, many of these investments support the fossil fuel industry, while others invest in false clean energy solutions like hydropower which often cause harm to local communities.“To achieve a just energy transition, MDBs and governments must prioritize sustainable renewable energy models that empower communities and ensure inclusive energy access,” a new op-ed argues.This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the authors, not necessarily Mongabay. The intensifying impact of the climate crisis on frontline communities in the Global South, record-breaking CO2 emissions, and global temperaturesexceeding1.5 degrees Celsius above average in 2023 are signs that we urgently need a just energy transition that reaches all levels of society. Through our work on theEnergy Finance Trackerat the International Accountability Project, we know that between 2022 to 2023, there were 933 known investments in the energy sector, totaling at least $139.8 billion, involving 14 multilateral development banks (MDBs) and more than 600 companies across 160 countries. From this simple data, we can tell that MDBs considered or approved, on average, more than one investment per day in the energy sector, many of which continue to support the fossil fuel industry, invest in false climate solutions, and fund energy projects that may bring jeopardy and harm to local communities. Governments and companies continue to rely on MDBs to support these investments in fossil fuels, specifically the oil and gas industry, despite their commitment to tackle theclimate crisis. These continued investments in oil and gas, with their devastating climate impact, directly contradict the Paris Agreement and are taking us many steps behind where we need to be to achieve a just and cleanenergy transition. Data from theEnergy Finance Trackerreveals a concerning trend of energy colonialism. Between 2022 and 2023, 10 MDBs invested a combined $14.5 billion in 80 oil and gas projects across 18 countries, with 66.3% of these projects involving private companies. The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) accounted for more than half of these investments. These three institutions are all led by countries from the Global North, yet 40% of investments were located on the African continent. Mozambique takes the lead in terms of total investment, receiving $3 billion for its oil and gas sector. Separately, Addax Energy S.A. is involved in aproposed investmentby the International Finance Corporation (IFC) aiming at financing petroleum product imports in West Africa. Outsourcing environmental and social harms seems to be a prerogative of the Global North when it comes to the fossil fuels industry. Beyond direct investment, MDBs like the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) fund technical cooperation projects that support governments in designing and implementing national energy policies that strengthen the continued reliance on fossil fuels. For instance, in Indonesia, theADBsupports the government’s energy reforms under a plan prioritizing fossil fuel infrastructure over renewables. Meanwhile, in Argentina, theIADBis supporting the implementation of Argentina’s Nationally Determined Contribution Plan 2030, the second,updated versionof which seeks to “increase the production of natural gas in absolute terms.” Investment in false solutions While the increase in investments that are less harmful to the environment and climate is generally a welcome trend, MDBs, governments, and companies continue to invest in false solutions in the name of renewable energy. Promoted as renewable energy and/or innovative solutions to tackle climate change, these solutions often have not been prioritized by the communities nearest to these investments, and may have hidden environmental and social costs that are neither adequately assessed nor disclosed. We can take an example from the push for hydrogen. Despite the claim of being a clean energy solution, the production of hydrogen contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which are the primary driver of climate change, and requires large infrastructure that adversely impacts local communities and the environment. However, there is a rise in investments towards ‘green’ hydrogen, with institutions like the IADB and the European Investment Bank (EIB)leading the way. Of the 35 hydrogen-related investmentstrackedbetween 2022 and 2023, a significant portion has been targeted to the Latin America region due to IADB’s numerous investments in the sector, likely to be backed by the new European Union (EU) hydrogen strategy. Fossil fuel-linked companies headquartered in Europe, such asEngie SAandIberdrola SA, also received funds to develop hydrogen research and infrastructure. This raises concerns about the actual environmental benefit of these investments. Other examples of false solutions includebiomassand waste-to-energy (WtE). Although biomass might seem like a renewable energy source because it’s derived from organic matter, large-scale reliance on it can lead to massive deforestation. In the past two years, EIB has been the primary financier of biomass projects.Similarly, WtE is often promoted as a ‘clean’ solution, despiteemitting300 times more greenhouse gases per unit of energy than coal plants and its facilitiesnegatively impactcommunities and waste pickers. In the past two years, ADB and IFC have been the biggest financiers of WtE projects. Alongside hydrogen, biomass, and WtE,carbon creditsare gaining popularity amongst MDBs with World Bank President, Ajay Banga recentlyannouncing plansto launch a mechanism for certifying forest carbon credits. However, rather than focusing on directly reducing their emissions at the source, carbon credits can potentially create a false sense of security and encourage polluters to continue emitting greenhouse gases as long as they can offset them with credits. This can delay urgent action needed to address climate change. Between 2022 to 2024, 10 projects supported the development of carbon markets, mainly financed by the World Bank and the ADB. The geographical focus is very broad, with projects located inIndonesia,Uzbekistan,India, andEcuador, among others. Potential jeopardy for local communities Many of the MDBs are increasingly working on projects and schemes on energy transition. While doing so, they are seen to provide continued support to fossil fuel-led infrastructure and remain unaccountable for harms faced by communities and workers. Recently, some MDBs like the Asian Development Bank have been taking steps to support governments in Asia in implementing energy transition programs to replace coal-fired power plants, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the details about the replacement energy sources often remain unclear. For instance, in Southeast Asia, atechnical assistance projectby ADB supporting the Indonesian State Electricity Corporationaims“to shift the power system from fossil fuel to low-carbon electricity supply,” but it has not been clarified if they will be fully replacing fossil fuels with renewables. In some cases, MDBs continue to rely on broad terms when describing energy transition projects such as ‘clean energy,’ ‘low-carbon,’ or ‘cleaner technologies’ even when coal is being replaced with natural gas, which some MDBs, includingADB,IADB, andEBRD, still consider a ‘clean’ energy source. We believe that this lack of transparency jeopardizes communities’ access to information, making it difficult for local communities and civil society organizations to understand the potential impacts of these projects in the future. A significant amount of energy investments by MDBs are also being directed toward large-scale energy projects that can potentially harm the land and resources of communities. In Dzongu Valley in Sikkim, India, we have seen how large hydropower projects, which arefalsely categorizedby some as renewable energy, can cause immense destruction to rivers and ecosystems, and displace communities from their lands. In October 2023, aglacial lake outburst floodled to the breaking of multiple dams which caused massive flash floods on the Teesta River in Sikkim, India. Despite the immense destruction caused by hydropower projects built on the ecologically fragile topography in the north-eastern Indian state, ADBproposedan investment in December 2023 for support to the power sector in Sikkim which may further lead to an increase in the development of the large hydropower industry. Another example can be seen in Malawi. Although solar infrastructure has the potential to address the lack of energy access in the African continent – and therefore it is often well-received by communities – land rights must be safeguarded and benefits equally redistributed among the affected population. In theabsence of community inputinto the decision-making process, many in the Salima community lost their source of livelihood due to the involuntary resettlement caused by the construction of a solar power plant funded by the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank (FMO) with aguaranteefrom the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and developed and operated by JCM Power Corporation, a Canadian private company. A community-led and just energy transition To achieve a just energy transition, MDBs and governments must prioritize sustainable renewable energy models that empower communities and ensure inclusive energy access. This requires a shift away from projects that threaten local livelihoods and cultural resources. The shift of policies and operations towards better practices in the energy sector needs to begin with complete divestment from fossil fuel operations including coal, oil, and gas, and the screening of intermediated investments to ensure their sub-projects are not associated with fossil fuel infrastructure and destructive energy projects. MDBs, governments, and companies should also stop promoting false solutions that are implemented without consulting affected communities, cause damage to the environment, and result in further grabbing of communities’ lands and resources. Rather, direct financial support through grants for communities in the Global South can foster decentralized, community-led renewable energy solutions. A prime example is the community-basedrenewable energy project in Parsibang, Nepal. This initiative, led by the local community in Khairang Village with the support of the Community Empowerment and Social Justice Network (CEMSOJ), provides electricity for Indigenous Tamang and Chepang communities. Community-led renewable energy offers a powerful alternative to large-scale projects. It fosters local ownership, empowers communities with direct energy access, and minimizes environmental risks and social disruptions. This approach ensures the benefits reach those who need them most.

"Surveys of several sites, including Nepal’s Chitwan National Park, show that the lesser necklaced laughingthrush may be physically mimicking a larger species, the greater necklaced laughingthrush, for benefit.Findings suggest the benefits for the smaller bird include no longer needing to be vigilant for predators when foraging for food, as the bigger bird does this job.Previous reports show the lesser necklaced laughingthrush is already known for vocal mimicry, where it produces the call of another bird.Mimicry among various species potentially serves as an evolutionary strategy for protection and foraging benefits. KATHMANDU — On an early spring morning in the western forests of Chitwan National Park in Nepal, a cacophony of birdsongs resonates through the air, mingling with the rustling of dried leaves and cries of other animals in the distance. As the sun’s rays penetrate the thick canopy, a feathered creature adorned with a dark arc looping across its breast and a striped white patch on its cheek serenades with a sequence of whistles that sound like laughter. A short distance away, a smaller bird, mostly brown with hints of rust on its neck and sides, and a conspicuous black pattern on its white chest, composes a tuneful and melodious call. In the shade of the bushes, the two birds appear similar. But they’re anything but. The two birds — the greater necklaced laughingthrushPterorhinus pectoralis) and the lesser necklaced laughingthrush (Garrulax monileger) — don’t even belong to the same genus, despite their names and their strikingly similar visual features. A new study looking at the interactions between the two species, which are found across South and East Asia, suggests that the smaller of the laughingthrushes may have adopted mimicry of the bigger bird as an evolutionary strategy to potentially placate the greater laughingthrush when it’s around, gain some level of protection against predators, and get better access to food by foraging near the larger bird. “The lesser laughingthrush appears to be mimicking the greater by adjusting the colors of its feathers to match that of the bigger bird when the species live together in mixed flocks in the same geographic area,” researcher Kamal Raj Gosai, who recently completed his Ph.D. looking into the interactions between the two birds, told Mongabay. “This mimicry is particularly evident in the similarity of the brightness of the necklaces of the two birds when they are in close proximity,” he added. “But the lesser’s feather colors are different when they are not living with the greater.” As part of the new study, Gosai and his colleagues looked at both museum specimens and live birds in the field. For the former, they took photos and measurements of the specimens, focusing in particular on the color and size of the necklace pattern on the breast, and determined whether the specimens came from areas where both species occurred together or separately depending on where they’d been collected from. For the live birds, they looked at flocks where birds from both species were present, or mixed-species flocks. Three of these surveys were carried out in China, and one in Nepal’s Chitwan. The surveys also included observations of the behavior and foraging of the two species, Gosai said. From their findings, they were able to conclude that, where the two species occurred together, the lesser necklaced laughingthrush could be trying to look and behave like the greater necklaced laughingthrush to get along with the bigger bird and the reap benefits of its presence. “There could be numerous benefits of mimicry for the lesser necklaced laughingthrush,” Gosai said. “For example, when the two species are foraging together the lesser necklaced laughingthrush could concentrate on the food rather than exercise vigilance against potential predators.” The researchers also noted that the greater laughingthrush could be more aggressive toward predators and raise an alarm when they’re around — a vigilance measure that the smaller laughingthrush could take advantage of. In areas where the greater laughingthrush was absent, the lesser one had a less prominent necklace, as judged by the lighter coloration of the breast feathers. There was no such change noted among the greater laughingthrush, suggesting there’s no evolutionary benefit for the species to mimic the lesser bird. The authors of the study note that due to the limited scope of the study, they couldn’t compare other characteristics of the two birds, which could make the mimicry hypothesis either stronger or weaker. “Future research could delve deeper into the plumage similarities and differences between the two birds beyond the necklace feature,” Gosai said. It could also investigate the behavioral interactions between the two in more detail to elucidate how mimicry influences social dynamics, foraging behavior, and overall fitness within mixed-species flocks. Conducting field experiments to simulate the presence or absence of mimicry between the two could provide valuable insights into the functional significance of mimicry in their interactions, the authors of the study note. Various laughingthrush species are already known for vocal mimicry, where they produce the calls of other birds. The lesser necklaced laughingthrush was previously reported to have done just that in Chitwan, according to ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral. Baral, who wasn’t involved with the recent paper but has studied vocal mimicry among gray-sided laughingthrushes (Pterorhinus caerulatus), said the findings make a strong case for convergent evolution — where one species will evolve a trait shared by another that confers it some degree of benefit. “This is crucial as we tend to think of evolution as being divergent, with different species developing characteristics different from other species,” he said. Neither the greater nor lesser necklaced laughingthrush is considered a threatened species, so at first glance there doesn’t seem to be a conservation implication from the study. But Gosai noted that birds such as laughingthrushes are indicator species for the wider forest ecosystem: when there’s a healthy population of the birds in a forest, they help in different processes such as pollination and control of insect population, for instance. “That’s why research into least concern species is also important,” he said.

"Nepal’s government has issued a controversial ordinance bypassing parliament to enable foreign investment in various sectors, including protected areas.The ordinance coincides with Nepal’s Investment Summit, facilitating projects like cable car routes and hotels within national parks.Details of the ordinance remain undisclosed, but it reportedly amends laws governing protected areas, allowing construction in previously restricted zones.Critics have expressed concern over the potential long-term consequences, questioning the impact on conservation efforts and local communities. KATHMANDU — Nepal’s government has bypassed the country’s parliament to issue a controversial ordinance facilitating foreign investment in different sectors of the country, including protected areas, in a move that could have long-term consequences for the country’s hard-won conservation gains, experts say. Although the details of the ordinance, signed into law by President Ram Chandra Poudel on April 28, are still under wraps, a government spokesperson told reporters that it amends several prevailing laws, including the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, which governs protected areas in Nepal. “The government is yet to publish the ordinance in the [official] gazette, so we don’t know the details yet,” Padam Shrestha, a lawyer who specializes in natural resource litigation, told Mongabay. “However, we can say that it is part of the government’s wider effort to open up protected areas to infrastructure development.” According to independent media reports citing different sources, the ordinance authorizes the government to declare an area as falling outside of “highly sensitive” zones (such as national parks), and allows the construction of different types of infrastructure. Infrastructure developments classified as “projects of national pride” include those projects of national priority and big-ticket foreign investment projects. “The ordinance yet again talks about sensitive areas within national parks. But in the past, the whole protected area itself was considered a sensitive area,” said lawyer Dil Raj Khanal. “Now they are classifying areas within protected areas as ‘highly sensitive.’ At this rate, they might further classify zones within protected areas as ‘very highly sensitive’ areas and ‘most very highly sensitive’ areas,” he added. “It doesn’t work that way.” Nepal is home to a dozen national parks, a wildlife reserve, a hunting reserve, six conservation areas, and 13 buffer zones. These are dotted across the breadth of the country, from the lowland Terai Arc to the high Himalayas, covering nearly a quarter of the country’s total land area. Although local people were displaced to establish national parks in the southern lowlands, people continue to live inside some national parks and conservation areas, such as Sagarmatha (Everest), Langtang and Annapurna. The government issued the ordinance on the eve of the third Nepal Investment Summit, which it organized to showcase investment opportunities to foreign investors. Some of the projects on the list include the development ofcable car linesin the Annapurna region, and ahotel inside Rara National Park, home to the world-famous pristine Rara Lake. The projects would have faced legal barriers in the absence of such an ordinance. “These projects could have long-term consequences for Nepal’s conservation gains achieved through a lot of effort and sacrifice,” said a conservationist working for a prominent international NGO, who asked not to be named for fear of government retribution. “It also does injustice to local communities who have been forced to make sacrifices and bear the cost of conservation. But the profit from the projects will only land in the pockets of corporates.”  Similarly, there are several cases related to infrastructure development being heard in court. “The ordinance could tilt the balance in favor of developers, most of whom aren’t following environmental safeguard guidelines,” Shrestha said. Parliament, which is currently in its annual recess, must endorse the ordinance within six months if it is to continue to remain law. As the government commands a simple majority in parliament, it’s expected to do that. “But the law may no longer be relevant after six months as most of the court cases would have been settled, with developers citing the ordinance to further their cause in court,” Khanal said. The ordinance came as a surprise even to officials working on different regulations to open upprotected areas to infrastructure. “We were in discussion about the new proposed regulations when we heard the ordinance was issued,” said an environment ministry official familiar with the developments. “But with the ordinance, the regulations may not even be necessary,” he added. The new law comes only a few months after the governmentopened up protected areasto commercial hydropower plants, doing away with the old policy that only allowed local communities to build plants of up to 1 megawatt for local use. The new policy opens up the possibility to develop commercial-scale projects of any capacity entirely within a national park or a protected area.

"In the period between winter and spring each year, Kathmandu faces severe air pollution that affects thousands of residents with health problems like burning eyes, respiratory discomfort, and even death.Local sources like vehicle emissions and construction dust, compounded by Kathmandu’s geography, are the main drivers of the pollution, and rising global temperatures threaten to worsen the situation.Changes in weather patterns, including reduced rainfall and prolonged dry periods are among the changes that could make air pollution an even more severe problem than it already is.Wildfires, both natural and human-induced, contribute significantly to air pollution in Kathmandu, especially during the transition period between weather systems, which could become longer due to rising temperatures. KATHMANDU — Whenever 60-year old Saraswati Adhikari goes for a morning walk in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, she says she feels a certain unease in her chest. “I get a burning sensation in my eyes and nostrils and I have mucus streaming out for a long time,” says Adhikari, a diabetic whose doctor has advised her to go on walks to keep her blood sugar level in check. Thousands of Kathmandu residents like Adhikari experience elevated levels of air pollution following the end of the winter season. At this time of the year, every year, the city ranks as one of the most polluted in the world in terms of air quality. On some of the days, it has even topped the list. Air pollution is already a major killer in Kathmandu, accounting foraround 5,000 deaths a yearin a city of around 1.4 million people. The main drivers of this pollution are emissions from vehicles and factories and dust from construction work, exacerbated by the city’s location in a bowl-like valley that leads to thermal inversion, which traps airborne pollutants close to the ground. Researchers warn that rising global temperatures could potentially amplify the problem. “In the short term, the level of pollution in Kathmandu is determined by the amount of rainfall it receives,” says climatologist Sudeep Thakuri. In general, the more rainfall, the better the air quality, as the precipitation flushes the pollutants out of the air. “However, the amount and frequency of rainfall in Nepal has been changing due to rising temperatures,” Thakuri tells Mongabay. According to the 2023 Air Quality Report by monitoring platform IQAir lists Kathmandu as the 11th most polluted city in the world last year in terms of weighted average concentration of PM2.5, a form of particulate matter that’s so small it can be inhaled. Similarly, Nepal ranks eighth on the list of most polluted countries in the world for the same metric. “Our research has shown that rising temperatures may lead to weaker precipitation and warmer winter and spring seasons,” Thakuri says. Such a scenario doesn’t bode well for Kathmandu in particular and Nepal in general, which relies on two weather systems for rain during winter and summer. During winter, rain clouds moving east from the Mediterranean bring rains to the western and central parts of the country, including at times Kathmandu. During the summer, the monsoon rain clouds moving west from the Bay of Bengal bring rainfall to eastern and central Nepal, and at times western Nepal. However, both systems have become less predictable due to climate change. Researchers in neighboring India say they believe thefrequency of western disturbances in South Asia is decliningand not carrying much moisture to induce rain in lower altitudes and snow at higher elevations in recent years. Anotherstudysays that rising temperatures could lead to an increase in frequency and duration of western disturbances in the long run, but that hasn’t been observed in the last few years, and there seems to be a general agreement that climate change is making westerly disturbances hard to forecast. Anecdotal evidence from Kathmandu residents suggests the spring drought period, when the western clouds have left South Asia and the eastern monsoon is yet to develop, is getting longer. Pre-monsoon rains, induced by locally developed systems, have also been elusive this year. Similarly, the prevalence of El Niño conditions in the Pacific has also been observed to bringbelow average rainfall in South Asia, including Nepal. According to researchers, rising global temperatures could induce extreme weatherevents linked to El Niño. Back in Nepal, as the air dries up and temperatures soar, the threat of wildfires around the country, known for its successful community-based forest conservation efforts, increases dramatically, especially in April. While some of the fires have been attributed to human activities — farmers burning hay and wheat husks to increase the fertility of their soil — others start naturally. India also faces a similar situation.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has also long been saying that incidents of forest fires are likely to increase in a warming world. In Nepal, as in India, when the wildfires rage, the concentration of pollutants in the air goes up significantly. “The pollutant we need to worry about is black carbon,” says air quality specialist Bhupendra Das. Black carbon, or soot, is believed to increase air temperature in the short term. Another recentlypublished studysuggests that wildfire smoke could be leading to increases in PM2.5 levels in Kathmandu during the gap period between westerly activity and the onset of the monsoon. The study, which used satellite data and air trajectory models to study the association between PM2.5 levels in Kathmandu between 2018-2022, found that significantly high levels of the pollutant could be attributed to wildfire smoke from neighboring and transboundary areas. This underscores the nature of air pollution as both a local and a regional and global problem, Das says. Therefore, controlling local sources of pollution in a city like Kathmandu may not be enough. Conservationist Rajendra Narayan Suwal, who spoke at a recent event in Kathmandu to discuss the problem, said better management of forests in the region also needs to be incorporated into measures to control air pollution. He added that community forest users should be made aware about fire control measures and about the harm that slash-and-burn farming can bring to human health and the environment. The association between rising temperatures and air pollution means that if countries around the world make an effort to control air pollution, it will have positive impacts on emissions as well, Das says. However, he notes, there’s a tendency to look at the two issues as being separate from each other. Meanwhile, Adhikari says she checked the weather app on her phone every day, looking for the possibility of rain. “It says there is zero possibility of rain,” she says. “With the monsoon a full two months away, I don’t know how long I can live with my respiratory problems.” Banner image:Morning view in Kathmandu.

"Conservation biologist Reshu Bashyal highlights gaps in Nepal’s implementation of CITES regulations, leading to ineffective protection measures.Nepal’s transition to a federal system has brought challenges and opportunities for orchid conservation, with local communities often unaware of conservation needs.Protected areas struggle to prioritize plant conservation alongside charismatic megafauna, while road construction further fragments orchid habitats.Bashyal emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about the significance of wild plants and updating inventories to guide conservation efforts. Orchids (members of the familyOrchidaceae)are diverse flowering plants with colorful and fragrant blooms and are often described as neglected plants in Nepal, where an estimated 500 or so of the roughly 30,000 species known to science are found. Most orchid plants require tree limbs for support and don’t need soil to grow — hence the garland-like appearance. Also referred to as the “tigers of the plant world,” orchids have been found to be at the receiving end of unsustainable harvesting and international trade for use in Ayurvedic as well as traditional Chinese medicine. One of the orchid species found in Nepal,Paphiopedilum venustum,has been listed as endangered by IUCN and listed under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), permitting trade only in exceptional circumstances. Almost all others are listed under Appendix 2, meaning their trade must be controlled in order to ensure utilization is compatible with their survival. Reshu Bashyal, a conservation biologist with a focus on wildlife trade research and policy implications associated with the NGO Greenhood Nepal, has been working on orchids for the last few years. Her work takes her to different parts of the country where she works with various communities and government agencies to understand the trade in the species and its implications for conservation. Mongabay’s Abhaya Raj Joshi recently met Bashyal at her office to talk about the challenges and the way forward for orchid conservation and research in Nepal. The following interview has been translated from Nepali and edited for clarity. Mongabay: In 2023, you and your team published a study on how CITES-related domestic laws in Nepal are impacting the orchid trade in Nepal. How did the study come about? Reshu Bashyal:We were actually working on a baseline study for orchid trade in Nepal and were reviewing various national, regional and local legislation related to trade in endangered species in Nepal. That’s when we decided to work on this study. Mongabay: What are the conclusions of that study? Reshu Bashyal:We saw that there was a gap in implementation of the laws, as they didn’t come about from a bottom approach. Despite the changes in the law, people continue to practice their culture and way of life, which sometimes involves poaching of different types of plants and flowers such as orchids. The other issue is that policymakers list certain species under Appendix I [trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances] and certain species under Appendix II [species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival]. They then say they believe that the species concerned are now protected. However, the listing itself may not be backed by field-level research. There is also a misconception that a species listed in CITES can’t be traded. However, that’s not the case. It allows the trade of Appendix II species provided that the government prepares a species management plan. However, such plans are rarely prepared in Nepal, and Appendix I and Appendix II species are treated in the same way. Mongabay: Nepal, which had long been a unitary state, is not a federal country with some sovereign powers devolved to provincial and local governments. How has this added to or addressed challenges related to orchid conservation? Reshu Bashyal:At the central level, we have the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and the Department of Plant Resources. At the local level, we have community forest user groups that look after and manage forests. The user groups, with the help of the provincial forest offices, come up with five- and 10-year operational and management plans that often refer to various legal instruments such as CITES. Although questions can be raised about the process employed to prepare the plans, whether all stakeholders are consulted or not, the plans are there. Mongabay: In the case of community forest user groups, we have seen that their primary focus is on extracting timber from the forest, and they are relatively unaware of even wild animals, let alone plants. Reshu Bashyal:That may not always be the case. Local people are also knowledgeable about orchids, which they callsunakhariin Nepali. But at times, they hide and prosper in plain sight, as people allow plants to thrive on their own without intervening. Recently, we came across a clump of critically endangered orchids at an easily accessible forest near Kathmandu. We were faced with a dilemma: whether to tell the local people about it or not. Not telling them about it would be akin to hiding information; telling them what it was would risk people coming to see and even pluck them. But in the end, we told a group of selected people about it but with a note that it needs further research. Mongabay: What about the situation inside protected areas such as national parks? Reshu Bashyal:We have a heavy presence of law enforcement such as troops of soldiers inside the national parks. But in the case of plants such as orchids, it’s very difficult to regulate poaching, as poachers can easily hide the plants. The other main challenge for protected areas is that they are designed to meet the needs and requirements of charismatic megafauna such as tigers (Panthera tigris) and rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis). Plant resources and precious flowers such as orchids are not on the radar. Mongabay: Where is the market for orchids? Is it in Nepal or somewhere else? Reshu Bashyal:We haven’t seen people use orchids to prepare medicine in Nepal. But it’s used in traditional Tibetan medicine as well as Ayurveda. We assume that it’s also used in traditional medicine of different Indigenous groups. Mongabay: What are some of the challenges in conservation, in addition to the illegal trade and its regulation? Reshu Bashyal:The construction of roads in different parts of the country is a major challenge for orchid conservation. When roads are built, trees are cut and heavy machinery is used to level the land. Often, we have seen builders bulldoze past orchid clumps without understanding the value of these flowers. Mongabay: As you go around different parts of the country, don’t you get requests from friends and family to bring them orchids to plant at home? Reshu Bashyal:Yes, I used to get that a lot. However, we don’t bring wildflowers back to our home. Most wildflowers, including orchids, don’t survive in domestic conditions. I tell people who want to grow wildflowers at home that they are called so for a reason and their beauty needs to be appreciated in the wild. Mongabay: How challenging is it to deal with traders and harvesters? Reshu Bashyal:The first thing we do is tell them that we are not undercover agents and we won’t report them to the police, nor do we name and shame them. So, they open up to us and tell us how they go about their trade. In the beginning, they think we also want to be a part of their trade. For example, when we visited a village recently asking about orchids, they told us they would get us as many plants as we wanted but we’d have to pay for them. As researchers, we need to understand that future researchers carry our baggage and our actions will affect the way people look at other researchers. So, we need to be very careful about adhering to research ethics. Mongabay: What about the temptation to take photos and post them on social media? Reshu Bashyal:Until a few years ago, I hadn’t realized how photos of orchids revealing their location would create problems for conservation. Later, I realized that potential poachers can retrace my steps to get hold of the plants. So, these days, I don’t take photos of orchids, however tempted I may be to see them in full bloom. Mongabay: What should be the way forward? Reshu Bashyal:The first step is to raise awareness that wild plants are equally as important as wild animals, as most of our conservation work is focused on charismatic megafauna such as tigers and rhinos. Then, there’s the challenge of identifying and preparing an updated inventory of orchid species in Nepal and making law enforcement aware about what’s legal and what’s not. Also, we need to prepare management plans for species listed under Appendix II. So, a lot needs to be done. Banner image:Dendrobium longicornu orchid flower from Nepal. Image by Kumar Paudel.
