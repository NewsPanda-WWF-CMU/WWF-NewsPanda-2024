But extreme heat is challenging productivity in these sectors.Sprinkling water on cages, ensuring the animals have enough drinking water and soaking gunny bags and laying them on roofs or the bodies of animals are popular ways of reducing heat stress in animals.Improving shed design, and incorporating decentralised renewable energy are some of the innovative techniques farmers are espousing to reduce heat stress further. Funding these interventions, however, remains a challenge. On a hot summer day in 2020, Savitri Bhanse went to tend to her chickens in her small backyard farm. But her ordinary routine of checking and feeding her chickens was upended by a crisis that spiralled out of control. “Some 50 to 70 chicks died in one day, just like that. They couldn’t survive because of the heat,” she told Mongabay India. It was her second year rearing chickens with the Kesla Poultry Society, a cooperative of tribal women poultry farmers operating in Narmadapuram district (formerly Hoshangabad) in Madhya Pradesh, and the first time she’d experienced a loss of this kind in one fell swoop. Extreme heat can be deadly for poultry and livestock. Poultry makes up50% of India’s total meat production, while dairycontributes 24%to the country’s agriculture sector. Together, dairy and animal husbandrymake up 4.5%of India’s total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But extreme heat is challenging productivity in these sectors, which are set to grow as India’s population rises. Commercial farms with more capital are better equipped to mitigate the impacts of heat stress, with some providingindustrial-scale air ventilation systemsin their sheds. Smaller and marginal farmers like Bhanse, are more at risk of experiencing losses in productivity or mortality on account of high temperatures. “Among the total agriculture households in India, 89.4% or 83.2 million are from small and marginal agriculture households. Small and marginalised farmers in India, post the Green Revolution, have seen degradation of soil, declining yield and furthering climate stressors without reaping the benefits,” said Nirmita Chandrashekar, senior program manager at SELCO Foundation, a social energy enterprise delivering sustainable energy solutions for the poor. Small interventions such as changing roofing material or shed design can be life-saving for livestock exposed to heat in the summer months. Savitri Bhanse, who owns 500 chickens, credits the installation of a solar-powered cooler in her farm for preventing losses like the one she faced in 2020. On the boil Theoptimum ambient temperaturefor chickens is between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius and heat stress can set in when ambient temperatures rise to 30 degrees or higher. This causes their already high internal temperature of 41 to 42 degrees to shoot up. In the absence of sweat glands, chickens have limited avenues to release the heat building up in their bodies. If internal temperaturescross 46 degrees, heat stress in chickens can be fatal. Similarly, livestock likecowsandpigsthrive when ambient air temperatures are between 15 and 27 degrees Celsius. “Cows have a lot of metabolic heat, which comes from energy released from food consumption. If there’s an overload of heat, it causes an imbalance of microbes in the body which prevents proper digestion and leads to discomfort in the animal. It will begin to pant to try and expel the heat. If the heat cannot be offloaded, it builds up and causes stress,” explained Teja Reddy, lead manager of veterinary services at Akshayakalpa, an organic dairy enterprise based in Karnataka. This year’s summer is expected to be especially severe, with extreme heatprojectedin most parts of the country through April, May and June. Heatwaves over India haveincreased in durationby 2.5 days between 1961 and 2021 due to global warming, according to the India Meteorological Department. Climate change is likely to make heat waves longer, more frequent and more intense over the next few decades if warming continues at current rates. A study in the Lancet projected milk productioncould reduceby as much as 25% in India’s arid and semi-arid regions by 2085 due to global warming. Pigs, too, are less productive at high temperatures. Compared to those maintained at 21 degrees, pigs exposed to 32 degrees Celsius werefound to consume between 60-100 grams lesswith every degree rise, corresponding to a decrease in body weight gain of 35 to 57 grams per day, per degree rise. The resulting impact on farmers spells a direct loss in income. Savitri’s neighbour, Sushila Parthe, has been rearing chickens since 2008 and doesn’t have a cooler for her flock of 1000, instead managing with a thick thatched roof and an airy shed. While she hasn’t dealt with high mortality, her chickens suffer from low weight over the summer months, she told Mongabay India. Low weight gain, coupled with reduced demand during auspicious Hindu months like Sawan, which call for the abstinence of meat, means the loss is doubly worse for farmers like her. “During the summer, I only earn Rs. 7,000 or Rs. 8,000 per batch, compared to the winter, when I’m able to make between Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 14,000,” she said, adding, “Those months are difficult, but I manage because my children send money home.” Harekrishna Deka, managing trustee and chief operating officer of the National Smallholder Poultry Development Trust (NSPDT), a country-wide network of smallholder rural women poultry farmers, told Mongabay India that 95% of chickens sold in India are sold live, where weight plays an important role. “Where there are no coolers, we try to make interventions in other areas, like replacing asbestos sheets with thermally insulated ones or solar-operated fans to reduce the build up of gasses in the sheds,” he said. Other measures, like sprinkling water on cages, ensuring the animals have enough drinking water and soaking gunny bags and laying it on roofs or the bodies of animals are popularly employed techniques by farmers to stay cool, but are temporary in nature. Improving shed design The solar operated cooler used by Savitri was given to her by SELCO Foundation, through their Sustainable Energy led Climate Action Program (SELCAP). Thermal discomfort can arise from poor shed design, unhygienic and cramped conditions and cheap but heat absorbing roof materials like asbestos, said Chandrashekhar. The Foundation partnered with the NSPDT to develop solutions for temperature regulation, including distribution of coolers and experiments with roofing materials. The Kesla Poultry Society, under the NSPDT, distributed around 400 solar-operated coolers in the Narmadapuram (Hoshangabad) district and studied how they impacted farmers compared to farms without coolers. They found that the coolers saved Rs. 2.17 per kg in production costs, resulting in savings of over Rs. 9,37,641 in total for the Society. “A producer with cooler installed sheds was paid an average of Rs. 5,233 in a batch whereas producers without coolers were paid an average Rs. 4,312 in a batch,” the analysis, shared with Mongabay India, said. The average flock size per batch was 500-700 birds, in a cycle of 35-38 days. Positive as the results have been, the capital cost of purchasing and installing the cooler is still prohibitive for smallholder farmers, said Deka. The high cost, at around Rs 40,000 per cooler, has been the biggest bottleneck in scaling up their installation. In the absence of coolers, other solutions, like solar operated ceiling fans are being installed in other farms. Siddalingaswamy, a dairy farmer from Madarasabpalya village in Karnataka’s Tumakuru district plans on experimenting with his shed design to allow more cross ventilation for his 20 cows. Siddalingaswamy is a farmer with Akshayakalpa. “I’ve been a dairy farmer for the last four years, but I only felt the need to install shade and foggers this year due to the heat,” he told Mongabay India, adding, “The foggers are only helping reduce the heat stress by a small margin, so I will try replacing my asbestos roof with zinc and increase the length of the shed to eight feet, with height of ten feet.” Akshayakalpa supports its farmers with shed design in order to optimize milk yields, said Rajeev Krishnamurthy, a development engineer at Akshayakalpa. “We use architectural planning, HVAC system design and considerations for natural ventilation to come up with initial designs for sheds and their prototypes,” said Krishnamurthy. The designs are modified through an iterative process before being piloted and eventually scaled. “These sheds often incorporate features like natural ventilation, proper lighting, and comfortable flooring to enhance the well-being of dairy cows.” An internal analysis by Akshayakalpa from 2016 to 2022 shows that in each year, average daily yields per cow in their specially designed sheds gave between 1.2 litres and 3.7 litres more milk compared to conventional sheds. In addition to higher yields, the sheds are also cheaper to construct, according to the analysis. The cost of setting up a conventional closed shed is Rs. 3,20,725. An open shed using Akshayakalpa’s design can be constructed for Rs. 1,70,000. “Over time, this increased productivity could offset the initial construction costs and provide economic benefits,” said Krishnamurthy. The next frontier is establishing a model to fund decentralized renewable energy projects so they are affordable for marginalized farmers, said Chandrashekhar. Zero interest loans, subsidies through National and State Rural Livelihood Missions, or carving out allocations within the District Mineral Foundations or Watershed Development Funds are some of the ways these projects can be integrated to support other development agendas. “We have the evidence, so now the question is how do you build enough consensus for more scale to happen? One approach is to look at national animal husbandry and veterinary departments or ministries to see how this type of intervention can be combined with existing programmes,” she added.

A denuded river basin, built-up lake beds and wetlands, tarmacked and tiled pavements, and parking lots on green spaces — all these contributed to making a cool “lake city” into athirsty onethis summer. Bengaluru’s conservationists’ mantra of “reduce, recycle, recharge” now finds more takers as climate change makes more cities go dry. For starters, the state government hascurtailed watersupplies to big users such as corporates and started penalising people forwasteful use of water.Meanwhile, the Karnataka government’slake rejuvenation programmehas given a respite tosome local neighbourhoodsas the city reels under a seriouswater crisis. “As a quick step, we can fill some lakes with treated wastewater,” Vishwanath Srikantaiah, one of Bengaluru’s most famous water conservation activists, told Mongabay-India. An urban planner, Srikantaiah advocates judicious management of water sources — piped river water, lakes, rain, groundwater, and wastewater. Further, Reshmi M.K., associate professor in the architecture department at Christ University Bengaluru, told Mongabay-India, “A holistic approach integrating blue, green and grey infrastructure can alleviate water scarcity in the city.” That means creatively linking water supply, green spaces and built-up spaces. These lessons are relevant for different parts of the world facing high temperatures and uncertain rains brought about by climate change and variability, experts say. What happened in Bengaluru While drying up of the Kaveri river basin during thedeficit rainslast monsoon is often cited as a key reason, the Bengaluru water crisis has a long history and complex connections, experts note. Srikantaiah draws from history. Bengaluru of the yore had interconnected lakes, tanks, and wetland spaces lined with trees and gardens — some of them built by the 16th-century founder of the city, Nadaprabhu Kempegowda. Stone inscriptions, however,showevidence of even older systems of the 7th and 8th centuries. Successive regimes, notably the Hoysala, the Vijayanagara Empire, the Wodeyars, and Tipu Sultan, promoted them to the point that the British called it acity of a 1000 lakes. As Bengaluru grew dramatically, as a World War I military base, an aerospace hub, and a global infotech hub, the city lost its blue infrastructure. As T V Ramachandra, coordinator of the energy and wetlands group at the Indian Institute of Science, pointed out in a recentinterview, 86% of Bengaluru water bodies have vanished since the 1800s with just 193 of them in existence now. During the same period, 76% of its green cover vanished to a mere 4% in existence now. Now the Kaveri river provides 60% of Bengaluru’s water, but its river basin has lost 45% of forests in five decades to a meagre 18%, as he noted in the interview. The city has seen a 1,055% increase in its grey infrastructure involving built or paved spaces and around 80% reduction in water bodies, Ramachandra said in anotherinterview. The rapid urbanisation since the 1960s has accelerated the trend of the loss of blue and green spaces, turning the city grey. Catch the rain Even after all these losses and continuing mismanagement of lakes—which allows encroachment, exploitation by private water suppliers, and rampant pollution—saving rainwater can be a magic bullet. With its 700-850 mm annual rainfall, the city gets about 15 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of rain—70% of the water needed, Ramachandranoted. That means catching the rain where it falls. “Rainwater harvesting from rooftops and stormwater harvesting from open spaces make up a viable solution,” said Reshmi. However, only ten percent of the city’s rainfall is captured, while most of it is drained out, overwhelming an inadequate infrastructure, she added. That means flooding during the rains. Tiled surfaces that leave little space for grass to grow or water to percolate downmark the city pavements and parking lots. Such hard surfaces prevent water absorption into the ground, conservationists note. “Bengaluru’s tank system can serve as potential reservoirs for the harvested water, which can be reused in the city. Rain harvesting will not only recharge lakes but also fill groundwater aquifers. Srikantaiah is a fan of open-dug wells, which have existed at least since the Indus Valley civilisation. Wells make groundwater visible—filling up during the rains and dipping when it is dry. He pointed out that dug wells dramatically increase groundwater recharging. Growing demand, novel solutions Recentstudiesestimate that urbanisation and climate change will lead to water demand exceeding supply for 1.7 to 2.4 billion people, or a third to nearly half of the people living in cities, by 2050. Indian cities are projected to be some of the worst affected, with large cities exposed to water scarcity increasing from 193 to as many as 284. Worldwide, as growing cities will increase water demand by 50–80% over the next three decades, it will involve water reallocation from villages to cities through inter-basin transfers called ‘hydraulic reach,’ a 2019studypoints out. The author, Dustin Garrick, currently at the University of Waterloo, and colleaguesnoted,“Proposed solutions include groundwater exploitation, seawater desalination, increased water storage in reservoirs, inter-basin water transfer, improved water-use efficiency, and urban landscape management.” The above study titledRural water for thirsty cities, however, does not find enough evidence to say whether the reallocation project is truly effective, equitable and sustainable. Except the seawater route, Bengaluru is testing all the other solutions. “In the face of fluctuating supplies, meeting the growing urban water demands and finding a sustainable balance among the city, its rural hinterland and environmental flow requirements are becoming increasingly challenging,” as newresearchshows. Still, the above study titled ‘Rural water for thirsty cities, however, does not find enough evidence to say whether the reallocation project is truly effective, equitable, and sustainable. Closer to home, the wisdom of the complexengineeringinvolved in bringing water from the Kaveri over100 kmaway and540 metresuphill is sometimes questioned. So are the rural-urban equity issues involved. However, as Srikantaiah noted in an earlierinterview, half the people of the Kaveri basin in Karnataka live in Bengaluru, and the city gives out its wastewater for irrigation. He says the issue is more about equitable distribution within the city. Garrick and colleagues further suggest solutions such as ‘sponge cities’ that absorb a lot of rainwater through sustainable drainage and efficient green infrastructure, ‘smart cities’ aided by technology and data, ‘low-carbon’ cities that cut emissions through cycling to recycling, and ‘resilient cities’ that absorb, recover and prepare for future shocks. As Srikantaiah translated it for Mongabay-India: “Have a clear vision for water needs of the future, use all forms of water wisely in a planned manner, protect your river and river basin, create well-rounded water institutions, capacitate them and finance them adequately. Then hold them accountable for sustainable, universal water availability for humans and nature.”  Banner image:To deal with the water crisis in Bengaluru, the government has curtailed water supplies to big users such as corporates and started penalising people for wasteful use of water.Photoby Sustainable Sanitation Alliance/Flickr.",India Conservation

The wetlands also host over 250 species of resident and migratory birds.Lack of natural flood water circulation, erosion and expansion of agriculture and infrastructure is contributing to the shrinkage of water bodies in the island. Legend has it that in a village on the island of Majuli in Assam, whenever someone needed something, they would go to a nearby beel (wetland) and pray to the water god (devata) and their wish would be fulfilled.  Even today, the wetland is known as Bhakati beel, meaning ‘the beel of devotion.’ “Symbolically, this legend shows the significance of wetlands in the life of the people of Majuli,” says Gobin Kumar Khound, a writer and local environmental activist in the island. “Beels are the arteries of Majuli.” Situated in the middle of the Brahmaputra, the landscape of Majuli is dotted with a string of beels. The variety of these wetlands is so rich that there’s an elaborate indigenous taxonomy of water bodies in Majuli. In thebook,Slow Disaster: Political Ecology of Hazards and Everyday Life in the Brahmaputra Valley, Assam(2023), political ecologist Mitul Barua writes, local people in Majuli divide the wetlands into many categories depending on their size and characteristics, such asbeel, jan, suti, erasuti, dubi, ghuli, hola, pitoniand so on.“A string of beels in a landscape indicates the presence of major rivers in it in the past, which may have migrated channels over time. Majuli is a classic case of that, given the elaborate network of beels found all over the island,” writes Barua. In 1917,there were 49 named streams draining Majuli, which decreased to seven by 1972. Today, there’s only one drainage channel, Kakorikata, that drains the whole of Majuli. And Tuni, the only river in Majuli, that once meandered through the island like a serpent has ceased to flow. Sand deposits and silt have choked water bodies across the island. Larger wetlands have reduced in size and many smaller ones have disappeared. A combination of factors is contributing to the decline of wetlands in Majuli, including building of embankments and consequent lack of natural flood water circulation in large parts of the island, expansion of agriculture and infrastructure and erosion. The lifeline of Majuli Beels are the primary wetlands in Majuli. A beel is a billabong or a lake-like wetland with static water, typically formed by the inundation of low-lying lands during flooding where some water gets trapped even after floodwaters recede. Beels are perennial water bodies. In the upper Brahmaputra valley, where Majuli is located, a large number of people depend on a range of ecosystem services provided by wetlands. According to astudypublished in theIndian Journal of Agricultural Economicsin 2022, an estimated 200,000 people depend on fishing activities in the wetlands of the region. In Majuli, beels ensured food security of the local populace, including marginal communities such as the Mishing and the Koibartta. However, with the decline of the wetlands, fish production in Majuli has reduced drastically over the past few decades. Tilak Chandra Sarmah, a grassroots conservationist in Majuli, says, “Now the situation is so dire that if there isujan[shoaling or schooling of fish] in a beel that has only a small number of fishes, hundreds of people will queue for a catch.” The scarcity of local fish in Majuli is so high that for the last several years, fish has been importedto meet the local demand, adds Sarmah. Decline of wetlands has impacted other local livelihoods as well. As wetland areas in Majuli decrease, the local demand for boats has dwindled, forcingtraditional boat-makers of the islandto look for other occupations, states a 2020studyon the impacts of wetland degradation on local livelihoods in Majuli. A paradise for birds in decline Majuli’s fertile floodplains and once highly productive wetlands used to provide an ideal habitat for a plethora of resident and migratory birds, more than250 species. Historically, the wetlands of Majuli were well known for birds, and Ahom monarchs used to visit the island for falconry. One such historical bird habitat in the island is Sorai Chung wetland. Consideredas an Important Bird Area (IBA), local communities believeSorai Chungto be one of the oldest royal bird sanctuaries in the world. Khound, who has recently published a novel titledSorai Chungset in the history of the area, says that this historical wetland has now shrunk to about 5 square kilometres. “The shrinkage of the wetlands has led to a decrease in the water bird population in Majuli,” Shyamal Saikia, a research scholar at Assam University who is working on grassland birds of Majuli, says. “Decrease in the fish population in beels has in turn impacted the birds dependent on fish.” In Ujani Majuli revenue circle, migratory birds frequent wetlands like Bordoloni, Aaroi Khowa, Bokajan, Goriya Beel, Sengeli Mora, Gelgeli, Koroiyoni, Xoriyohtoli, Nangoli Mukh, Aamguri, Kotai, Rotiram Jan, Kotai Nahoroni, Sorola Pothar. Many of these wetlands are under encroachment. Nevertheless, Saikia says that some wetlands are still in healthy condition and have the potential for development of sustainable ecotourism. “Unfortunately,” writes political ecologist Barua inSlow Disaster, “despite the presence of hundreds of beels in Majuli, some of them with great historical and ecological significance, none of the beels have been designated as a Ramsar site. Such a recognition could have perhaps helped conserve these wetlands better.” The 1950 earthquake and a series of floods In1950,an earthquake of 8.6 Richter scale, changed the Brahmaputra valley, including Majuli’s wetlands, forever. The earthquake radically reconfigured the courses and configurations of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries, and raised the riverbed of the Brahmaputra by a few metres. In his account,The Great Assam Earthquake 1950, Frank Kingdon-Ward, a British botanist who was travelling to the upper reaches of the region at the time, stated that the earthquake resulted in multiple landslides in the hills and the rivers got flooded with enormous amounts of sediments, which led to a change in the river pattern. Following the earthquake of 1950, three heavy floods occurred during 1951, 1954, and 1962, the last being the most severe according to the people of Majuli. A 2014studystates that Majuli has lost a huge area “due to combined effects of earthquake and consequent deposition of excessive sediment in river bed transported from the geologically fragile upper hilly catchments causing the river to braid erratically.” Locals say that several wetlands turned shallow following the earthquake of 1950, ultimately leading to drying up of the water. “For example, Pahumara jan was a run-off from the Tuni river and flowed to the Kherkatia suti,” says Sarmah. “Now, Pahumara jan has transformed into a patchwork of paddy fields and a few small water bodies called dubi.” Similarly, Polonga beel and Phuloni beel, located in Phuloni, have shrunk considerably following the earthquake of 1950. Parts of these wetlands have now been turned into agricultural fields. Locals say, about 50 years ago, Polonga beel was a favourite spot for resident and migratory birds. Yet another wetland, Gela beel, has vanished as a result of the geomorphological changes triggered by the 1950 earthquake. Erosion and embankments According togovernment data, Majuli has reduced in size from 1,250 square kilometre at the beginning of the 20thcentury to 483 square kilometre by 2014. Many wetlands have been lost to erosion. For example, Keturi beel, located to the east of Salmora, behind a village called Lahkar Gaon, has been lost to erosion. No traces are left of Lahkar Gaon and Keturi beel. Erosion-induced migration and increasing population pressure as the island continues to lose its landmass, have triggered encroachment on wetlands. “With pressure on land increasing, people have turned several wetlands into paddy fields and homestead,” says Khound. More than 100 kilometres of embankments have been constructed in Majuli as part offlood prevention measures. All water channels, which are linked with the Brahmaputra and other major rivers, have been blocked by embankments surrounding the island. “This has divided the island into two distinct geographies,” says Jaya Kalita Gogoi, assistant professor of geography in Majuli College. “The area inside the embankments has stopped seeing natural flood, while areas outside the embankments experience heavy flood.”. Consequently, silt deposits, water hyacinth, grass, and solid waste accumulated over the years has made wetlands inside the embankments shallow, impacting aquatic life. “Certain amount of flooding is necessary to keep the beels alive, while excessive flooding may be harmful,” says Gogoi. On the other hand, when floods breach embankments, it leads to heavy siltation in these wetlands. One morning in September 2023,thousands of fish turned dead in Kakorikata beel, a large wetland in the Chilakola area of the island. Local forest officials said this was caused by lack of oxygen in the wetland, as the beel was choked by sand deposits, solid waste, and water hyacinth. Some water bodies are being dug as part of theAmrit Sarovar Schemein order to rejuvenate. “However, only time will tell what results this scheme yields,” Sarmah says. “What is concerning is that no environmental agency is involved in the scheme’s implementation.” Further, there’s a concern that schemes like this may turn parts of natural wetlands toculture fisheries. Potential solutions “The potential solution,” according to Sarmah, “is to make the natural water flow happen through Majuli.” “Revival of the Tuni river is vital for the survival and rejuvenation of Majuli’s wetlands as all the beels are connected to this river,” Sarmah says. “The major water bodies should be made weed-free and degraded bodies de-silted.” Tuni, the only river in Majuli, has been blocked by an embankment towards its lower reaches in a place called Patia. As a result, the river’s capacity to flow has reduced considerably, and water hyacinth, sand deposits, and waste materials have choked the river and slowly pushed it to death. “While constructing embankments and infrastructures, it needs to be ensured that natural floodwater is able to enter the landscape and pass through it,” Sarmah adds.

The meeting aimed to discuss strategies to mitigate the negative effects of linear infrastructure on elephants and wildlife. This initiative builds uponGaj Utsav Odisha, a visionary campaign by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) which was launched by Shri Pradip Kumar Amat, Hon’ble Minister, FE&CC, Odisha, Govt. of India in October 2023. Odisha is home to over 1900 elephants spanning three elephant reserves and having 12 identified elephant corridors. While these majestic animals roam freely across the country’s vast landscapes, they face challenges in their right to move across their natural habitats. Launched in 2018, the Gaj Utsav campaign seeks to raise awareness about safeguarding the future of India’s National Heritage Animal, while also advocating for their essential Right of Passage across elephant range states in India. The discussion brought together stakeholders from the Forest Department, East Coast Railway, Electricity Board and Irrigation Department | Photo by Upasana Ganguly The meeting was presided over by Dr. Manoj Nair, IFS, CCF (WL), Odisha Forest Department, and attended by 20 representatives from the Forest Department, East Coast Railways, Electricity Board, the Irrigation Department and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). The discussions primarily focussed on strengthening the policy guidelines for avoiding, reducing and mitigating the adverse impacts of linear infrastructure such as power lines, canals, pipelines, and railways on wildlife. One of the major concerns of linear intrusions is the alarming mortality rate of elephants, with approximately 45-50 elephants dying due to electrocution annually in India, and over 367 elephants falling victim due to train accidents since 1987 alone. Deliberations on finding solutions to mitigate elephant deaths from electrocution were central to the discussion. Dr. Manoj V. Nair, IFS, APCCF Wildlife, Odisha Forest Department addressed the group | Photo by Upasana Ganguly The meeting also highlighted the ongoing conservation initiatives undertaken by the Odisha Forest Department and WTI’s interventions at safeguarding elephant populations. Additionally, brainstorming sessions were conducted to explore innovative approaches to restore connectivity for wildlife across linear intrusions. A Handbook on ‘Mitigate the Impacts of Roads and Railways on Asian Elephants’ by IUCN AsESG’s (Asian Elephant Specialist Group) Asian elephant transport working group was officially released by Dr. Manoj Nair, IFS, CCF (WL), Dr. Sandeep Tiwari, Chief of Conservation, WTI, Mr B.B.

Years after Bihar banned alcohol, its active ingredient, ethanol, is finding a fresh use. The central government has approved47 ethanol plants in the state, of which at least 32 are grain-based. Ethanol can be extracted from plants such as sugarcane or maize after they are fermented and processed. The ethanol thus derived is mixed with petrol or diesel to make blended fuels for vehicles. This blended fuel is considered to have a lower environmental impact. Also, more domestic biofuel would mean fewer fossil fuel imports and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018, India had set a target of blending 20% ethanol in petrol by 2030, under theEthanol Blended PetrolProgramme. By that period, it aims to replace approximately1,016 crore litresof petrol with ethanol. Producing this vast quantity of ethanol would require around165 lakh metric tonnesof food grains. It alsoachievedthe goal of blending 10% ethanol in petrol nationwide in June 2022, five months earlier than the set target. Bihar’s food-to-fuel industry Bihar was the first state in India to introduce an Ethanol Production and Promotionpolicyin 2021, which encouraged new ethanol factories to start operations in Bihar. The policy also aims to increase farmers’ earnings, generate local jobs, and attract investors. Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, secretary of the department of agriculture in Bihar, reveals that the maize production has doubled in the state in the last three years, which further encouraged more ethanol plants. “If you look at Bihar, we are agri-surplus. Rice, wheat and maize are grown in huge quantities. We also have a lot of ground water…Seeing this potential, the government introduced the Ethanol Policy 2021. The response was very good. Bihar has the most ethanol plants at present, in India,” shares Kunal Kishore, Founder and Director, InvestAid India. The Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Industries, Bihar, Sri Sandeep Poundrik confirmed that there are 15 ethanol plants which have started work in Bihar, of which nine have already commenced production, and six plants are under construction. Over 60%of ethanol is produced from sugarcane molasses in India. But with maize being a substantial part of Bihar’s farming produce, the state aims to increase its grain-based ethanol production. Read more:India aims to go big on sugarcane-based ethanol, but water intensity of the crop throws up concerns Maize price goes up with demand The increased demand for maize to produce ethanol, has created fresh opportunities for maize farmers, and the price of maize has  gone up as well. “Currently, the price of maize is between 2,300 and 2,400 rupees per quintal. Three to four years ago, the price was around 1,600 to 1,700 rupees per quintal,” says farmer Dheeraj Kumar from Bisanpur, Purnea. Along with the farmers, the ethanol factories have benefited with the rise in price for maize too. Dilip Patel, the promoter of an ethanol plant Patel Agro Industries Pvt. Ltd. shares, “This (the price rise) has directly benefited the farmers. The Bihar government has offered us (ethanol plants) more subsidies compared to other states. First, the government will provide up to 10% of the bank’s interest as a subsidy. Second, there is also a significant GST exemption. They also provided a lot of incentives for things such as investment in workers. Any industry requires various clearances to be set up, which the Bihar government quickly provided.” However, the rising maize price could also be a cause of concern for Bihar and other states. Ramya Natrajan, a researcher at CSTEP who specialises in alternative fuels notes, “Studies in other countries like the U.S. have shown that this increases the prices of food; there is a lot of inflationary effect of this. We might be seeing that in India. If the demand for ethanol increases, the demand for maize as a food grain, will increase. People will want to cultivate more and more of it, but then it will increase its price.” This story was produced with the support of Internews’ Earth Journalism Network.

As temperatures rise in Karnataka’s Malenadu region, located along the Western Ghats, the residents remain on high alert due to the resurgence of a tick-borne illness endemic to India—Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD). Locally known as monkey fever ormangana kayilein Kannada, this viral haemorrhagic disease, caused by aFlavivirusin the family ofFlaviviridae, carries an estimated fatality rate of3% to 15%. Dengue, in comparison, killsaround 2.6%of the infected, according to an estimate. The zoonotic disease follows a predictable annual cyclic pattern, emerging during the peak winter months of November and December, reaching its zenith in the summer, and then disappearing completely with the onset of monsoon, only to resurface with varying intensity the following year. Since January this year, the region has alreadyrecorded 12 deaths, and more than 250 positive cases of KFD. The recent demise of a seven-year-old child in Uttara Kannada district due to KFD has heightened concerns. Highlighting the gravity of the situation, K.P. Sripal, a Shivamogga-based advocate and a member of the KFD Janajagruthi Okkoota, a civil society group advocating for better accountability and government protection against the disease, notes that this tragic incident marks the first child fatality from the disease in over 30 years. While we couldn’t verify the claim due to a lack of data, Dr K. J. Harshavardhan, deputy director of the government-run Virus Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL) in Shivamogga, says that a child’s death is a rare occurrence in KFD cases. “Young children do not go into the forest often and they also have better immunity against the virus. This death is a rare one,” he tells Mongabay-India. Health officials also observe a broader trend wherein KFD cases peak approximately every four or five years, although no official study has been conducted to substantiate this claim. This trend could potentially be due to the four to five-year immunity the body builds against the virus after an attack, points out Shivamogga resident Darshan Narayan, a scientist with ATREE who has previously worked with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the state health department on the disease. Thus, 2024 holds particular significance, as the local residents and officials report that the last major outbreak in this region occurred in 2019. A looming threat of deficient rainfall and intense heat,conditions conduciveto the proliferation of ticks, provides additional risks this year. “The absence of customary December showers, which typically flush away ticks in their nymph stage—when they are most virulent—has been particularly concerning,” explains Harshavardhan. “While case numbers surged in January and February, there appears to be a promising downward trajectory in March,” he adds. This Mongabay-India correspondent travelled to Kyasanur and Aralagodu villages, Shivamogga town, and surrounding areas to interview residents and officials at KFD’s hotspots.  How Kyasanur found its place in history Kyasanur Forest Disease was first identified in 1957 within the Kyasanur forest range, adjacent to a village of the same name in Soraba taluk of Shivamogga. The sudden death of numerous monkeys, followed by fevers in individuals with a history of forest exposure, prompted the then government (the Government of Mysore) toinitiate emergency measuressuch as free distribution of antibiotics for typhoid. Initially suspected to be typhoid and then yellow fever, subsequent investigations revealed ticks as carriers of an “unknown” virus. Interestingly, despite its name being associated interchangeably with the deadly disease, the village of Kyasanur never reported a death from the disease or has not had any positive KFD cases in the last 25 years, according to the records with VDL, as noted by Darshan. Reflecting on the pivotal days when the disease first emerged, Huchappa, a nonagenarian from Kyasanur village, recounts guiding four forest officers in masks and gloves to the site of the deceased monkeys in the forest. “We spent a fortnight in the forest, returning with the dead monkeys in gunny bags and two live monkeys, caught using sugarcane as bait, in a cage.” He had a ringside view of the historical event unfolding as no other resident was willing to go into the forest with the officers. Huchappa hazily remembers those monkeys asbili mangaor white monkeys, likely referring to Hanuman langurs. Furtherlaboratory analysesconducted on various tick specimens collected from monkeys, bovines, rodents, and humans, by the former Virus Research Centre in Pune, in collaboration with The Rockefeller Foundation, alongside state public health experts, led to the isolation and coding of the virus as P9605. Is land use change responsible for KFD’s spread? During the early stages of detection and research, it was speculated that the virus might have been transmitted via ticks carried by migratory birds. However, the prevailing theory now suggests that thevirus is endemic, and likely circulating within the Malenadu forests from an earlier period. Due to the dense forest cover and minimal human activity within these regions, the virus remained relatively undisturbed. However, with deforestation and significant alterations in land use and ecological dynamics, the virus and its carriers were brought into closer proximity to human populations. Sixteen tick species—most of them belonging to the genusHaemophysalis—out of 40 species of ticks recorded from KFD affected areas, have been found to be carrying the virus. The virus finds its maintenance and amplification within various host animals, each responding differently to infection. Humans, acting as dead-end hosts, typically encounter the virus accidentally and do not contribute to its natural cycle. Small mammals such as porcupines, squirrels, and rodents serve as reservoir hosts, crucial for sustaining the virus’s circulation between ticks and reservoir hosts. Although these animals become infected by the virus, they typically do not display symptoms of illness. In contrast, primates such as Hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) and bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata), serve as amplifying hosts. The virus undergoes amplification within their bodies, leading to symptomatic infection similar to that seen in humans. The occurrence of monkey deaths serves as a significant indicator, acting as a “sentinel event,” signalling a potential epidemic in the area. From 1957–1971, the disease wasconfined to Shivamoggadistrict. It started spreading to the neighbouring district of Uttara Kannada in 1972 and eight years later, in 1980, cases were reported from Chikkamagaluru and from Dakshina Kannada in 1982. In 2012, the disease was reported from Chamarajanagara district and the Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu. The following years saw it spread to neighbouring states of Kerala, Goa, and Maharashtra, as well as other districts of Karnataka like Belagavi, Gadag, Mysuru and Hassan.

A total of 17 species were observed roosting, while 12 species were found nesting.Species such as the red-naped Ibis, glossy ibis and woolly-necked storks, which have been scarcely studied, were found nesting and roosting within the city.The waterbirds were spotted on 23 species of trees, including neem and eucalyptus, most often those located near or on waterbodies. Traditionally, crowded cities may seem like unlikely places for wild species to thrive, given the impacts on critical behaviours like roosting and reproduction. However,recent researchchallenges this assumption, revealing that waterbirds across Africa and South Asia are adapting and even thriving in urban settings, by making use of human-made structures and resources. Despite this discovery, there remains limited knowledge on how these birds choose sites for crucial activities like roosting and nesting in urban areas. To address this gap, a study was conducted in Udaipur, Rajasthan, to investigate the cues for selecting roosting and nesting sites, and to ascertain if various species of waterbirds employed similar cues. “In India, research on urban biodiversity and its ecosystem services is notably lacking. This oversight means that cities are rarely considered as wildlife havens. But the reality is different. Our study in Udaipur reveals abundant breeding colonies and waterbird roosting sites within the city. This suggests that we may be missing out on documenting a substantial portion of waterbird populations by solely focusing on wilder habitats,” says K.S. Gopi Sundar, co-chair of the IUCN Stork, Ibis and Spoonbill Specialist Group, and one of the study authors. Where are Udaipur’s waterbirds? Nestled in southeastern Rajasthan, Udaipur is surrounded by a diverse landscape, consisting of the ancient Aravalli hills, villages, small towns, scrublands, agricultural lands, and open areas. The study authors note that there existed limited knowledge regarding Udaipur’s waterbirds, with only a few checklists. “Urban ecology studies are biased towards large and mega cities, with very little work done on small cities of the tropics and sub-tropics,” says Sundar. They documented waterbirds within Udaipur city limits to assess their roosting and nesting habits. They recorded several species, including little cormorant, Indian cormorant, great cormorant, little egret, intermediate egret, great egret, cattle egret, pond heron, grey heron, purple heron, black-crowned night heron, glossy ibis, black-headed ibis, red-naped ibis, painted stork, Asian openbill stork, and woolly-necked stork. “While certain species like egrets, herons, ibis, and storks have been sporadically spotted nesting in urban areas, our study represents the first comprehensive documentation of the entire waterbird community utilising a small city for both roosting and nesting activities,” says Sundar. The initial findings of the study revealed a significant presence of waterbirds roosting and nesting within the city limits. A total of 17 species were observed roosting, while 12 species were found nesting. The species most observed roosting in the city were the cattle egret, followed by the red-naped ibis, and the Indian pond heron. A total of 130 nesting locations were also identified, most belonging to the cattle egret, followed by the red-naped ibis, and Asian openbill. Read more:Birds in Delhi ponds remind us why we should not ignore small urban wetlands Read more:Birds in Delhi ponds remind us why we should not ignore small urban wetlands Roosting and nesting habits of waterbirds The researchersfoundthat the waterbirds exhibited a preference for roosting and nesting sites near or within water bodies. Roosting sites were frequently found adjacent to bustling roads and in heavily constructed areas. The team’s analysis also incorporated variables such as tree characteristics, land use around trees, and so on. These variables were examined across different spatial scales to gain insight into the preferences of waterbirds in urban environments. At the smallest scale, waterbirds steered clear of buildings near the trees they had chosen for roosting or nesting. At a larger scale, they chose trees located close to wetlands. Surprisingly, waterbirds displayed flexibility in their choice of trees for roosting and nesting, utilising 23 different tree species. However, most roost and nest sites were observed on the largest trees such as neem, eucalyptus, fig and babul. “We also observed that the waterbirds entirely avoided roosting or nesting on trees found on the Aravalli mountains surrounding and within the city of Udaipur,” says Sundar. Since research on waterbird roosting and nesting has rarely been conducted, the team held few expectations about what they would discover. However, the observed behaviour of waterbirds aligned with their anticipations of utilising the largest trees, particularly those situated near or within water bodies. “The utilisation of trees along roadsides and in built-up areas was surprising, but highlighted the importance of conserving old trees within cities,” says Sundar. The researchers feel that cultural norms that appreciate nature and wildlife may partly explain why waterbird roosts and nests were found even near buildings. “Species such as the red-naped ibis and woolly-necked storks, which have been scarcely studied, were found nesting and roosting within the city. The red-naped ibis, in particular, exhibited no distinct preference for any of the variables used to locate roost and nest sites, suggesting its adaptability to urban environments,” says Sundar. The study challenges assumptions about the species’ ecology and population trends, highlighting the pitfalls of making confident assertions based on limited information. Similarly, the glossy ibis, another poorly studied waterbird in the region, was previously believed to require relatively undisturbed large wetlands to survive. However, observations revealed its versatility, with individuals even utilising trees beside roads with heavy traffic for roosting. The road ahead As Udaipur city expands, the researchers believe it crucial that planning authorities prioritise conservation and greening efforts in urban spaces. “The value of old trees in urban areas cannot be overstated. These trees offer numerous benefits to cities and serve as vital habitats for waterbirds. By safeguarding old trees, we can enhance urban biodiversity and create win-win scenarios for both humans and wildlife,” says Sundar. The researchers also advocate for preserving all water bodies within and around cities, particularly in places like Udaipur, as they are essential ecosystems supporting diverse life, including waterbirds. The widening of roads too poses a significant threat to waterbirds as roadside trees are felled. Alternative solutions to road expansion must be sought to preserve trees, especially mature ones that provide essential shade. This may offer birds more nesting opportunities, potentially leading to an increase in waterbird roosting and nesting within Udaipur city. “The research findings can also guide conservation efforts for other bird species and urban areas. However, the diversity of urban settings across small cities requires customised conservation approaches. Further research in various cities is essential to identify specific strategies for conserving waterbirds and improving urban biodiversity,” says Sundar.

Fifty-year-old Sayeed Ahamed’s approach to shaping clay diverges from the conventional method employed by most traditional potters. Instead of relying on his hand’s motion to sculpt, he adopts a distinctive technique by positioning his right leg in a carefully carved hole under the ground. He kicks his leg underneath, which imparts motion to a lower wheel, which in turn drives the upper wheel, facilitating the shaping of clay placed atop it. This unique pottery technique, known as the kick wheel technique, offers a notable advantage — both of his hands remain entirely free throughout the process. As a seasoned artisan from a long line of potters, Sayeed Ahamed takes pride and claims, “You will not find another kick wheel anywhere in Khurja.” Others gathered there, nod their heads in support. While Ahamed’s approach appears innovative compared to traditional practices, it pales when one considers other extensive advancements that have revolutionised pottery production in Khurja, a city in theBulandshahr districtof Uttar Pradesh. Situated at approximately 85 kilometres away from Delhi, Khurja boasts a rich pottery history of at least 600 years. Its name, derived from the Urdu word “kharija,” meaningcancelled, reflects its history of swamps and scarce agricultural opportunities that led to waiving revenue from the town. Artisans in Khurja, thesixth largest cityin the National Capital Region (NCR), source clay from states such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Jharkhand. This clay undergoes a thorough process where it is initially mixed in ball mills and blungers, where high rotations per minute (RPM) mixing ensures the fine blending of clays, before being filtered and refined in cut mills to attain the desired consistency. The clay thus prepared, is fed into a roller-head machine for shaping, says Md. Arif Khan, a state award winner for his work and a master artisan at Minhas Pottery, one of the 23 export-oriented pottery units in Khurja. These units export ceramics to various countries, including the United Kingdom, USA, Australia, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, and more. The major items of export include ceramic artware, insulators, and scientific porcelain. Khurja’s pottery manufacturing has evolved into a hub of the ceramic industry, comprising over494 unitsin the small-scale sector and standing as one of the largest whiteware clusters in India. Following shaping, the pots undergo the firing process in the kilns. Sayeed Ahamed also utilises one of these small-scale units to fire his pots. Just behind his kick wheel at his residence in Khawesh Gyan in Khurja, there is a veranda full of racks where he keeps all the pots he has crafted. These pots get loaded on a cart and carried to one of such factories, where he rents a trolley or two depending on the number of pots he has managed to craft. Ahamed remarks, “These factories are at least two to three kilometres from my place. This task is challenging, fraught with the risk of pots being damaged during transport. We sometimes find ourselves waiting for several days just to secure a trolley. The costs are steep for small artisans; these factory owners charge us at least Rs. 3,000, whereas for them, it costs around Rs. 1,200.” A majority of the artisans, around 80% as per local claims, are dependent on these factories for the kilns.",India Conservation

Part 2 and Part 3 throw light on the technologies in use in the crop growth stage and the post-harvest stage. Farmers in India are always responding to the weather. However, predicting rainfall and weather events has become achallengein recent times. With the country’s population likely to touch the1.7 billion mark by 2050and the food demandexpected to rise, farming needs to become less climate-dependent and more cutting edge. Agricultural technology, abbreviated asagritech, aims to solve agricultural challenges such as low productivity, climate-resilience, soil infertility, low farm incomes, credit and insurance, fragmented supply chains, post-harvest losses and more. For some researchers and startups, the solutions begin even before the seeds are sown in the field. Engineering climate-resilient seeds Present day rice is a product ofdomestication of wild riceby our ancestors. But the crop faces variousenvironmental stressesdue to a changing climate. While both rice and millets evolved from the same grass family millions of years ago, millets can now withstand harsher temperatures and require lesser waterthan rice. What traits have themilletsgained, that rice has lost? This is what the researchers at The Millet Lab, University of Hyderabad are trying to understand. “Crops today face multiple stressors which lead to heavy agricultural losses. Biotic stressors such as diseases (fungal, viral, bacteria) and abiotic stressors such as drought, heat, salinity, impact crop growth and yield,” explains M Muthamilarasan, Assistant Professor, The Millet Lab. A biotechnology innovation called gene-editing, manipulates the existing genes of a crop’s seed to make them withstand these stressors and become climate-resilient. Regarding theapprehensionabout the safety of gene-edited and genetically modified crops, Muthamilarasan comments, “In the case of gene editing, we are not introducing any new gene as in the process for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We are carefully editing the existing genes to make them climate-resilient and they are foreign-DNA free.” “We have a responsibility to communicate this correctly as gene editing allows us to collectively bring some traits that make the crop climate-resilient or pest-resilient. If we are able to modify seeds with the help of biotechnology, we can foresee a future with a better variety of crops which have high productivity,” Manasi Mishra, Associate Professor, Biosciences and Technology at MIT World Peace University, tells Mongabay-India. Biotechnology researchers say there’s a need for speed to introduce gene-edited seeds in the market. “Breeding new seeds takes time; it takes years to develop. We need to expedite the research and develop seeds that are resilient against multiple stressors because a seed that is drought-resilient may not be able to fight pests,” Muthamilarasan adds. Several institutions are working on developing gene-edited crops to improve productivity and nutritional security, but they are not commercialised yet. India’sGuidelines for the Safety Assessment of Genome Edited Plants, from the Department of Biotechnology, makes it clear that the gene-edited plants require proper appraisal of biosafety concerns to make it safe for the environment and humans. It also outlines the roles and responsibilities of regulatory committees in the risk assessments of genome-edited plants. Mishra meanwhile calls for more collaboration in the scientific community. She writes in apolicy briefabout advancing the cooperation among G20 countries for agricultural biotechnology, “The G20 should prioritise technological cooperation to enhance agricultural productivity in developing and low-income countries…Knowledge-sharing, technological collaboration, and technological innovations in these sectors, as well as capacity building in the scientific community and academia should be prioritised.” Ethical and safety considerations in fortifying seeds to be resistant to climate change and pests, still persist, but Muthamilarasan is hopeful about the future of gene-editing. “Albeit one thing the gene-edited seeds can’t do, is to improve the soil. The fertiliser consumption is increasing and the land under agriculture is not increasing. It is making the soil infertile and poor,” he worries. What if farmers can learn the health status of their soil, which directly impacts crop yield, before they even sow? Rapid soil testing Agritech startup Krishitantra has come up with a rapid soil testing machine called Krishi-RASTAA, a joint initiative with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR). A farmer can simply collect soil sample from their field, take it to the nearest Krishi-RASTAA centre and get a soil health card in 30 minutes. “Soil testing labs require infrastructure, skilled personnel to handle chemicals and capital expenditure to construct the building. So, we miniaturised the whole thing into a small cubic-feet-equipment. We brought in advanced technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and made the process data-driven and efficient,” explains Sandeep Kondaji, CEO and founder of Krishitantra. Thesoil health cardassesses 12 parameters which includes pH, nitrogen, organic carbon, sulphur and more. It also contains recommendations to the farmer on how to improve the soil condition. “This information enables farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, and other agronomic practices, well in advance, ultimately leading to enhanced crop yield,” Kondaji shares. AI-powered soil testing systems can continuously monitor key soil parameters and provide real-time insights, which can help farmers implement soil management strategies before they sow a crop, he explained. Satellites spot Another real-time agritech solution that banks and insurance companies with exposure to agriculture are embracing, is satellite data. On what basis can banks lend money to farmers if they don’t have a credit score? Startups like SatSure are making this decision easy. “For banks to understand how much loan to sanction, they need to learn about the income generating potential of the farmer which is difficult to assess beforehand without knowing details about the farm history or the land’s productivity. That’s where our tech comes in,” begins Hiren Doshi, General Manager at SatSure, a deep tech, decision intelligence company. SatSure uses satellite data to generate a report for the farm, which helps banks in making agriculture loan decisions. The technology is live in about 15-20 banks in India – a mix of private, public and cooperative banks, says Doshi. He explains the process in detail, “Once we know which plot the farmer owns, a report is generated with 38 different parameters for the banks to consume, which answers questions about the crop grown, land under irrigation, yield, climatic-risks, income potential, etc. This is aggregated in the form of an easy to consume score called SatScore. Agricultural loan processing used to take a lot of time but now with this science-based, objective report, the banks can quickly process loans.” Satellite data also helps insurance companies process compensation for agricultural losses after diseases or extreme weather events. “We help them assess those claims by analysing the extent of crop damage,” Doshi adds. State governments are also interested in using satellite data to understand the extent of crop damage before they declare a disaster, request insurance companies for payouts and to develop effective agricultural policies. The scientific report helps governments declare relief measures for affected areas too. To scale-up satellite technology, Doshi believes that states must improve their digital infrastructure. “Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Haryana have access to digital land records. Hence, it’s easier to operate there. Also, the government’s support in publicly acknowledging the use of satellite data in decision-making, will help public sector and cooperative banks adopt the technology much faster.” An uneven adoption While researchers, startups, educational institutions and government departments are continually refining agricultural technologies to optimise climate-smart agriculture, the adoption of these technologies is uneven in India. A segment of farmers is not represented in this agritech boom. “It (the adoption) is often influenced by numerous factors such as agricultural practices, local agritech challenges, economic conditions, technological infrastructure, and state agricultural and food security policies/initiatives,” Purushottam Kaushik, Head, Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum, tells Mongabay-India. “India has diverse agroclimatic zones, each with unique crop suitability and dominance, so certainly, agritech solutions vary with respect to crops as well,” he continues. Kaushik is a part of Telangana’sAI for Agriculture Innovation initiative, a public-private partnership (PPP) to scale agritech services in India. He believes that an enabling ecosystem through public-private partnerships is essential to drive the agricultural process in a sustainable and just manner. In conversation with Mongabay-India, Srikanth Rupavatharam, Head,Innovations Hub, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics (ICRISAT) says, “The question is not about how receptive farmers are to new technologies. Farmers are very intelligent they are adopting technologies fast. Now, it’s about how people come together to negotiate higher output prices for production and lower input processes…And the last mile connectivity of these technologies is different for different states. In some parts of India, connectivity to phone networks is an issue which needs to be improved.” The gender gap in access to technology is another challenge. A2023 reportfrom a telecom non-profit GSMA states that even today, women in India, especially in rural areas, are less likely than men to use a mobile phone with key services such as internet or mobile money.

के दो टाइगर रिजर्व में पाए जाने इंडियन रॉक पायथन पर हुई एक टेलीमेट्री स्टडी में सामने आया है कि इसके घर की रेंज लगभग 4 वर्ग किलोमीटर होती है।इस टीम ने पहले पता लगाया था कि एक वयस्क नर अजगर की लंबाई आम धारणा से कम होती है।पहले की गई स्टडी में पता चला है कि उत्तर भारत और दक्षिण भारत के रॉक पायथन के प्रजनन के समय में अंतर भी पाया गया है। हाल ही में दक्षिण भारत के दो टाइगर रिजर्व में 14 इंडियन रॉक पायथन (Python molurus) पर हुई एकटेलीमेट्री स्टडीमें इस प्रजाति के कई पहलुओं पर प्रकाश डाला गया है। इस स्टडी ने इन सांपों की पारिस्थितिकी, वितरण, जनसंख्या और भारत में इनके व्यवहार से जुड़ी सीमित जानकारी में इजाफा किया है। भारत दुनिया के कई बड़े सांपों को घर है। तमिलनाडु के सत्यमंगलम और मुदुमलाई रिजर्व में की गई इस स्टडी का उद्देश्य इस प्रजाति के घर की रेंज के बारे में समझना था। इस रिसर्च पेपर में कहा गया है कि किसी प्रजाति के घर की रेंज समझने से उस प्रजाति के व्यवहार की पारिस्थितिकी को समय और स्थान की स्केल के हिसाब से समझा जा सकता है। कई मूलभूत कारक जैसे कि खाना ढूंढने के पैटर्न, विस्थापन, फैलाव और प्रजनन की सफलता सीधे तौर पर जानवरों के इस्तेमाल की जगह पर निर्भर करता है। भारत में दुनिया में सांपों की सबसे ज्यादा प्रजातियों वाला देश माना जाता है। यहां अजगर की तीन प्रजातियां पाई जाती हैं- इंडियन रॉक पायथन, बर्मीज पायथन और रेटिकुलेटेड पायथन। जहां इंडियन रॉक पायथन भारतीय महाद्वीप में पाया जाता है, वहीं बर्मीज पायथन सिर्फ पूर्वोत्तर भारत में पाया जाता है और उत्तर भारत के कुछ हिस्सों में सीमित क्षेत्र में पाया जाता है। वहीं, रेटिकुलेटेड पायथन पूरे दक्षिणपूर्व एशिया में पाया जाता है लेकिन भारत में यह सिर्फ निकोबार में सीमित है। घर की लंबी रेंज और लौटने की धीमी रफ्तार वाइल्डलाइफ इंस्टिट्यूट ऑफ इंडिया के वैज्ञानिक और स्टडी की अगुवाई करने वाले चिन्नास्वामी रमेश ने मोंगाबे इंडिया को बताया कि रिसर्च टीम को पता चला कि इन अजगरों की होम रेंज लगभग 4 वर्ग किलोमीटर होती है। इसके अलावा, अगर इन सांपों को अपने घर के आसपास की 13 किलोमीटर की रेंज में छोड़ दिया जाए तो ये अपने घर लौट सकते हैं। वह बताते हैं, “हमने पाया कि एक अजगर ने 13 किलोमीटर की दूरी तय करके अपने घर पहुंचने में 11 महीने का समय लिया लेकिन आखिरकर वह अपने होम रेंज में लौट ही आया।” रमेश के मुताबिक, इससे यह नतीजा निकलता है कि किसी भी रेस्क्यू किए गए सांप को अगर 13 किलोमीटर की रेंज के बाहर छोड़ा जाए तो वह अपने घर नहीं लौट पाएगा।” रिसर्चर्स ने पाया कि दूसरे बड़े सांपों की प्रजाति जैसे कि किंग कोबरा के उलट इन सांपों के वजन और उनके आकार और होम रेंज में कोई आपसी संबंध नहीं पाया गया।थाईलैंड में की गई एक स्टडीके मुताबिक, बड़े किंग कोबरा (Ophiophagus hannah) का होम रेंज बड़ा होता है जो यह दर्शाता है कि इन सांपों के आकार, मेटाबोलिक डिमांड और खाना ढूंढने के प्रयासों में आपसी संबंध होता है। अजगर शर्मीले और छिपकर रहने वाले ऐसे सांप होते हैं जो इंसानों से दूर रहना पसंद करते हैं। भले ही इनका आकार डराने वाला होता है लेकिन इंसानों पर इनके हमलों की खबरें बहुत कम ही आती हैं। आमतौर ये सांप इंसानों की ओर से परिवर्तित किए गए क्षेत्रों जैसे की खेतों और खाली मैदानों में पाए जाते हैं, जहां इनके शिकार पर्याप्त मात्रा में होते हैं। यह जरूरी है कि अजगरों के निवास स्थलों के पास रहने वाले किसान समुदाय को इन बड़े सांपों के फायदों के बारे में जागरूक किया जाए, ताकि उनका संरक्षण हो सके। रमेश जैसे विशेषज्ञों के मुताबिक, ये सांप किसानों के लिए मुफ्त में पेस्ट कंट्रोल का काम करते हैं। इंडियन इंस्टिट्यूट ऑफ साइंस के सेंटर फॉर ईकोलॉजिकल साइंसेज के वैज्ञानिक कार्तिक सुनागर कते हैं कि इस तरह की स्टडी बेहद जरूरी हैं क्योंकि हम भारतीय सांपों के बारे में बहुत कम जानते हैं। वह आगे कहते हैं, “यह हैरान करने वाला है कि हम बडे़ स्तनधारी जीवों के बारे में तो बहुत जानते हैं लेकिन सांपों के बारे में बहुत कम जातन हैं। इस तरह के शर्मीले जानवरों जैसे कि सांपों की होम रेंज के बारे में जानने से संरक्षण से जुड़ी रणनीतियां बेहतर तरीके से बनाई जा सकती हैं।” वयस्क अजगर के लिए अहम नहीं होता है आकार DST-SERB (द डिपार्टमेंट ऑफ साइंस एंड टेक्नोलॉजी- साइंस एंड इंजीनियरिंग रिसर्च बोर्ड) के सहयोग से हुई इस टेलीमेट्री स्टडी में तमिलनाडु के वन विभाग और सत्यमंगल टाइगर रिजर्व की वेटेरिनरी टीम ने भी मदद की. इसके अलावा, वाइल्डलाइफ इंस्टिट्यूट ऑफ इंडिया ने ट्रांसमिटर लगाने में मदद की। रेडियो टेलीमेट्री में सांप में फिट किए गए ट्रांसमिटर से निकलने वाले रेडियो सिग्नल का इस्तेमाल किया जाता है। इसके जरिए सांप की लोकेशन पता की जाती है और इसी के हिसाब से सांप को ट्रैक करके उसकी होम रेंज, उसके बर्ताव और ईकोलॉजी समेत अन्य कई चीजों का अध्ययन किया जाता है। और पढ़ेंःतस्करी से बचाये वन्यजीवों की बढ़ती संख्या बनी पूर्वोत्तर राज्यों के लिए समस्या और पढ़ेंःतस्करी से बचाये वन्यजीवों की बढ़ती संख्या बनी पूर्वोत्तर राज्यों के लिए समस्या रमेश ने बताया कि उत्तर और दक्षिण भारत में अजगरों पर उनके पुराने अध्यययनों में पता चला है कि उनके प्रजनन के समय में अंतर है। जहां दक्षिण के अजगर जनवरी में शुरू करते हैं वहीं उत्तर में एक महीने बाद यह प्रक्रिया शुरू होती है। हो सकता है कि ऐसा वातावरण के तापमान की वजह से होता है। प्रजनन के तरीके में अंतर देखा गया कि उत्तर भारत में सात से आठ नर अजगर एक मादा से संबंध बनाते हैं वहीं दक्षिण भारत में एक मादा से दो से तीन नर अजगर संबंध बनाते हैं। रमेश कहते हैं कि रेंगने वाले जीव समतापी होते हैं और वातावरण के साथ इनके शरीर का तापमान बदलता रहता है ऐसे में यह समझना जरूरी है कि तापमान की वजह से इनका व्यवहार और प्रजनन की प्रक्रिया कैसे बदलती है। रमेश और उनकी टीम की ओर सेसाल 2021 में की गई एक पुरानी स्टडीमें एक वयस्क रॉक पायथन के बारे में भी अहम जानकारी मिली है। पहले माना जाता था कि जब कोई अजगर सात से आठ फीट का हो जाए तो वह वयस्क हो जाता है लेकिन रिसर्चर्स ने पाया कि एक नर अजगर जो कि 6 से साढ़े 6 फीट (198 सेंटीमीटर) का था वह खुद से बड़ी मादा के साथ संबंध बना रहा था। रमेश के मुताबिक, इस नतीजे से इस प्रजाति के संरक्षण से जुड़ी रणनीति बनाई जा सकती है। वह कहते हैं, “भारत के लिए यह अच्छी खबर है क्योंकि यहां अजगरों की संख्या कम होती जा रही है। अजगर को पकड़कर रखने से ब्रीडिंग करना आसान होगा।” हालांकि, यह अमेरिका के लिए बुरी खबर है जहां बर्मीज अजगर पाए जाते हैं, पहले इसे इंडियन रॉक पायथन की उप प्रजाति माना जाता था। यह प्रजाति स्थानीय पारिस्थितिकी तंत्र पर एक आक्रमणकारी प्रजाति के रूप में बुरा असर डाल रही है। रमेश कहते हैं, “इंडियन और बर्मीज अजगरों की जेनेटिक संरचना बहुत अलग नहीं है और इनमें आपस में इंटर ब्रीडिंग भी होती है।” विशेषज्ञों को उम्मीद है कि यह स्टडी ऐसे अजगरों के संरक्षण से जुड़ी रणनीतियों को बढ़ाने में मदद करेगी जिनकी संख्या कम होती जा रही है।  इस खबर को अंग्रेजी में पढ़ने के लिएयहां क्लिककरें। बैनर तस्वीर:जर्मनी के स्टुटगर्ट के जूलॉजिकल हार्डन में एक इंडियन रॉक पायथन। इंडियन
