265,Jonas Siehoff,"Hunting of straight-tusked elephants was widespread among Neanderthals 125,000 years ago, finds study","Hunting the now extinct straight-tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus) was widespread among Neanderthals, concludes a research team consisting of members of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), the Leibniz-Zentrum für Archäologie (LEIZA), also based in Mainz, and Leiden University in the Netherlands.

The study has recently been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The researchers closely examined the bones of elephants that are approximately 125,000 years old that were discovered in Gröbern in Saxony-Anhalt and Taubach in Thuringia, Germany, decades ago. They were able to identify cut marks made by stone tools used by the Neanderthals that indicate that the animals must have been hunted before they were extensively butchered.
It was two years ago, during the analysis of bones found at the Neumark-Nord site in a former lignite mine in Saxony-Anhalt, that the same team discovered the very first evidence that Neanderthals actively hunted straight-tusked elephants, the largest terrestrial mammals of the Pleistocene. That study was published in Science Advances in early 2023.
""The results of the more recent examination of the bones from Gröbern and Taubach now show that the hunting of these elephants by Neanderthals was not an isolated phenomenon but must have been a more regular activity,"" emphasized Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser, Professor of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Archaeology at JGU and Director of the Archaeological Research Center and Museum of Human Behavioral Evolution MONREPOS in Neuwied, an institute run under the aegis of LEIZA.
Gaudzinski-Windheuser was extensively involved in the investigation of the bones from Gröbern and Taubach as well as the previous study of the bones from the Neumark-Nord site.
Palaeoloxodon antiquus roamed the landscapes of Europe and Western Asia 800,000 to 100,000 years ago. With shoulder heights of up to 4 meters and body masses of up to 13 tons, the European straight-tusked elephant was the largest land-living animal at the time, significantly larger than today's African and Asian elephants and even bigger than the extinct wooly mammoth.
""We have estimated that the meat and fat supplied by the body of an adult Palaeoloxodon antiquus bull would have been sufficient to satisfy the daily calorie intake of at least 2,500 adult Neanderthals,"" explained Gaudzinski-Windheuser. ""This is a significant number because it furnishes us with new insights into the behavior of Neanderthals.""
So far, for instance, researchers had generally assumed that Neanderthals associated in groups of no more than 20 individuals. However, the information now obtained in relation to the systematic exploitation of straight-tusked elephants indicates that Neanderthals must have gathered, at least temporarily, in larger groups or mastered techniques that allowed them to preserve and store large quantities of foodstuffsor both.
In a follow-up project, the researchers hope to learn more about how Neanderthals hunted these massive elephants and how their hunting activities impacted these and other prey animals as well as their environments.

The Asian elephant earned the moniker because she was the only captive elephant in the Philippines and lived alone at the zoo for decades, according to animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which has advocated for Mali.
Mali lived at the zoo for about 45 years and caught the attention of Paul McCartney in 2013 when he worked with PETA to raise awareness for the elephant and penned a letter to Philippine President Benigno Aquino III urging the transfer of Mali to an elephant sanctuary in Thailand.
At the time, PETA U.K. said Mali ""endures intense confinement, loneliness, boredom and isolation"" in an area that is a fraction of the size of her natural habitat.
An elephant sanctuary in Thailand was prepared to take Mali in, according to PETA U.K., but she stayed in Manila, where she was the main attraction at the zoo. 
Other celebrities, including Pamela Anderson and Jane Goodall joined the effort to ""free Mali.""

At the end of her life, Mali had cancer and was seen rubbing her trunk against a wall, meaning she was in pain, Dr. Heinrich Patrick Peña-Domingo, the chief veterinarian a the zoo, said at the news conference, according to BBC News. Vets gave her antihistamines and vitamins when she was breathing heavily on Tuesday, but she died later that day.
While animal rights activists advocated for Mali to be moved from her isolated home, the zoo argued it was the only place she had known and that vets were providing her with care, BBC News reported.
Mali was transferred to the zoo from Sri Lanka and following her death, PETA Asia urged the country not to send another one of its animals to Manila. 
In a statement to CBS News, PETA Asia said Mali, who was nearly 50, died in her ""barren concrete pen,"" because of ""indifference and greed."" The animal rights organization said living in what called solitary confinement is ""torture"" for female elephants because they naturally spend their lives alongside other female elephants and work together to raise their babies. 
""Despite PETA's repeated warnings, zoo and city officials ignored Mali's clearly painful foot problems, sentencing her to years of suffering,"" PETA Asia's statement reads. ""The Manila Zoo has announced that Mali had cancer that was not detected by their veterinarians until after she died. Due to the fact that there is no elephant expert in the country, Mali was never provided with routine veterinary care—something she would have been given at the sanctuary PETA was prepared to transfer her to.""
PETA Asia said those who denied Mali proper care and a different home ""should be held accountable for their part in allowing Mali's suffering."" 
CBS News has reached out to the Manila Zoo and is awaiting response. 
According to U.K.-based conservation charity People's Trust for Endangerd Species, Asian elephants, who are smaller than their African cousins, have an average lifespan of about 70 years in the wild — in captivity, it's about 80 years. The oldest Asian elephant in captivity died in 2019 in India at 88 years old, according to a piece credited to the group for BBC Wildlife Magazine. 
The Smithsonian National Zoo, however, says despite consistent data, evidence suggests Asian elephants typically live into their mid-50s and median life expectancy for female Asian elephants is 47 years old.

Vishwamali, nicknamed Mali, died on Nov. 28 of congestive heart failure at Manila Zoo in Manila, Philippines. 
It was believed that Mali was in her late forties. 
Malis death was announced on Tuesday in a Facebook video posted by Manila Mayor Honey Lacuna, whose happy childhood memories include frequent visits to see the elephant at the zoo.
Many on social media mourned the animals death, and several activists, including Dr. Jane Goodall and Paul McCartney, pleaded with authorities to transfer the animal to an elephant sanctuary when she was still alive. 
Mali lived alone in her pen for most of her life, according to the BBC, and arrived at the zoo in 1981. 
The beloved Asian elephant first started showing signs of distress last Friday when she was rubbing her trunk against a wall, a sign she was in pain, according to chief veterinarian Dr. Heinrich Patrick Peña-Domingo.

On Tuesday morning, Mali was lying on her side breathing heavily and died later in the afternoon, despite being given antihistamines and vitamins by veterinarians. 
An autopsy revealed that she had a blockage in her aorta and cancer in some organs. 
She lived a significantly shorter life than Asian elephants in the wild, whose average lifespan is 70 years, or other captive elephants that live until around 80, according to Discover Wildlife. 
The Smithsonian National Zoo said that evidence points to Asian elephants living until their mid-50s with the median lifespan clocking in at 47 years old. 
She moved from Sri Lanka to the Manila Zoo after the Sri Lankan government gifted her to the then-first lady of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos.

268,Guest Blogger,Economic Progress and Fossil Fuels: The Elephant in the Room at U.N. Climate Conference,"The reality of economic imperatives, however, will eventually expose the folly of decarbonization plans.
The post Economic Progress and Fossil Fuels: The Elephant in the Room at U.N. Climate Conference first appeared on Watts Up With That?.",https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/12/03/economic-progress-and-fossil-fuels-the-elephant-in-the-room-at-u-n-climate-conference/,https://wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wuwt-logo.jpg,2023-12-04T06:00:00Z,"The mainstream media are gearing up to bombard people with terms like climate emergency, climate justice and climate equity in anticipation of this weeks start of the 28th United Nations Conference of the Parties in Dubai.
They might even introduce catchphrases and announce historic breakthroughs in emission-reduction diplomacy. The public relations messaging of climate politics, however, has little connection with the economic realities of countries such as India that require heavy use of fossil fuels.
As politicians in fuel-guzzling jets prepare to descend on Dubai and lecture poor countries on energy morality, India is sending a subtle yet clear message that it is not giving up coal, oil and natural gas.
In India, elephants reign supreme, capturing the hearts of those who encounter them. With a staggering 32,000 elephants, the sprawling tropical forests of India are home to the sixth-largest population of these majestic creatures. In my formative years, I had the privilege of visiting these gentle giants in their native domain.
In recent years, Ive witnessed my native country rise as a metaphorical elephant that refuses to go away.
India  along with China and African and Southeast Asian nations has become the elephant in the room at the yearly U.N, climate gatherings. Leaders of the subcontinent have steadfastly asserted the countrys right to use fossil fuels, unwilling to comply with restrictive U.N. recommendations for energy policy.
The U.N. climate conference in 2015 was hailed as a pivotal moment as it sparked the creation of the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. But even at that time, Indias resistance was unmistakable.
During the formulation of the agreement, India vehemently opposed the imposition of stringent emission-reduction mandates on its economy. It played an integral role in devising of the term climate justice while arguing that economic progress should not be sacrificed by restrictions on the use of fossil fuels.
In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution a document where individual countries outlined their level of commitment to the Paris accord  India made clear that it would not compromise domestic energy security at the altar of climate religion.
At the 2022 gathering in Egypt, climate luminaries put forth a pioneering proposition to phase out all fossil fuels. Again, India persistently opposed such a course of action, opting instead to pursue a phase down rather than a phaseout of fossil fuels. With no intention to decrease its consumption of fossil fuels, the country has boldly put off net zero, the holy grail of the climate-obsessed, until 2070.
Unbeknownst to many, Indian Power Minister R.K. Singh conceded in August that meeting the burgeoning energy needs of a developing country like India would be unattainable without a noticeable escalation in the utilization of fossil fuels.
If you have an economy that is growing at 7%, electricity from coal will also grow, he said. We will meet the energy requirement for our growth because we have a right to grow.
CNBC reports unanimous agreement among analysts that Indias solar, wind and hydro energy capabilities are deemed unreliable to support growing power needs. Sooraj Narayan, Wood Mackenzies senior research analyst, says that Indias heightened power demand necessitates a reliable, cost-effective, and consistent power generation source, which coal currently fulfills.
India is the worlds second-highest user of coal and third-largest consumer of oil. India has had a dramatic surge in coal imports from Indonesia and is seeking new markets from which to buy coal. Many new mines are being opened annually.
At the G20 summit earlier this year, India proposed a new strategy called multiple pathways that seeks unabated, continued use of fossil fuels a direct contradiction of the Wests decarbonization schemes. This conflict may reemerge at the upcoming U.N. climate gathering.
Major developing economies seem unfazed by the yearly U.N. climate conference as they continue to meet energy needs with hydrocarbons. With the world relying on fossil fuels for 80% of its primary energy, this dependence is expected to grow with an increasing number of people trading poverty for prosperity in the coming decades.
Announcements about emission-reduction breakthroughs at these events are little more than flimsy shields trying to hide an elephant the climate elite refuses to acknowledge. The reality of economic imperatives, however, will eventually expose the folly of decarbonization plans.

Colossal Biosciences researchers in Texas who study ancient DNA found a 99.6 percent match between the woolly mammoth and the Asian elephant. It makes the species an ideal candidate for surrogacy and researchers plan to transfer a woolly mammoth embryo to an Asian elephant in 2026. If all goes according to plan, after a 22-month gestation period, the first woolly mammoth in millennia will be born in 2028.
Once the woolly mammoth calves are born, they'll be transported to their habitat in the Arctic circle, starting with Alaska and Canada.

Anyone who's seen the Jurassic Park films might believe that extinct species are better off left buried. But Colossal Biosciences CEO and co-founder Ben Lamm said that his company's work is drastically different than that of InGen in the movies mentioned above.
""Jurassic Park is a dystopian movie around not thinking about the unintended consequences of bringing back these species,"" Lamm told Newsweek.
Lamm and his team build out calculated plans for each extinct species they hope to bring back, including how they'll survive in their natural habitat and when to release them into the wild.
But there are plenty of animals that Colossal Biosciences won't bother reinstating because they could cause other species to become extinct.
""Part of the reasons as to why the dodo went extinct was not because they were stupid or because people liked to eat them, but it was the introduction of invasive species in their egg-laying ground,"" Lamm said.
One species Lamm has no plans on bringing back from extinction is the Christmas Island Rat, given its invasive tendencies.
Experts believe that the modern extinction rate is as much as 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate, also known as the rate of extinction that would occur if humans didn't exist, according to World Wildlife Fund (WWF), making for a dim outlook on the future of life. It's impossible to determine the exact number of extinctions occurring each year, given that researchers don't know how many species exist on the planet, as there are countless undiscovered species living in rainforests or beneath the ocean's depths. However, WWF estimates that from 200 to 2,000 extinctions occur every year if there are 2 million different species on the planet.
Return to life
Colossal Sciences has poured years of research and millions of dollars into the projects, and Lamm said the woolly mammoth work is ""well on its way."" However, scientists must study more than DNA to ensure the species' success. The company has partnered with several elephant conservation organizations for the project. It also studies animal husbandry and ensuring that the modern woolly mammoth wouldn't be susceptible to viruses that have killed its ancestors and relatives.
A rendering of a woolly mammoth. Colossal Biosciences is working to bring the species back to life. Colossal Biosciences
""We are trying to rebuild extinct species for today,"" Lamm said, adding that a research team is working to develop a vaccine to protect mammoth and elephant calves from the deadly Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpes Virus, the leading cause of death among Asian elephants. ""We really think about how to engineer a more resilient, healthier animal.""
The first generation of mammoths would live in expansive habitats managed and monitored by animal care teams.
""From there, we will implement a stage-gated process by which the descendant generations will be moved to larger and less managed facilities in what we call soft-release sites,"" Lamm said. ""Eventually, as those generations mature and demonstrate independence, they will be moved to 'wild' release sites.""
Also on Colossal Biosciences' list of projects is the dodo, a flightless bird on the island of Mauritius that went extinct in the 1600s, and the Tasmanian tiger, which vanished in the 1930s.
The future of artificial wombs
Colossal Biosciences conducts extensive research on which species could help the environment if they're brought back. Lamm said that the successful re-wilding of certain species, such as large herbivores and key carnivores, could be fundamentally important to ecosystem stability.
The Steller's sea cow could help the marine ecosystem in the Pacific Northwest, but efforts to bring the species back have been stymied by the lack of an adequate surrogate in today's world.
Colossal Biosciences has employed a 17-person team to work on artificial womb development to foster embryos of extinct species like the Steller's, a massive animal that reached up to 30 feet long and weighed up to 22,000 pounds.
""[Steller's sea cows] were marine mammals so important to our world, but there's nothing that we can currently gestate them in,"" Lamm said. ""They were really important to the kelp forests, important to carbon sequestration, but it's just too big.""
The Steller's was discovered in the mid-1700s, but hunted to extinction less than 30 years later.
""I think we will be successful whether it takes five years or 10 years,"" Lamm said.
While it'd be astonishing to bring woolly mammoths or other extinct species back to life, Colossal Biosciences also focuses its research on saving the animals that are alive today.
""Conservation is really important on the path to de-extincting these species,"" Lamm said. ""We are developing better assisted reproductive technology that could help critically endangered species now.""

TROPICAL forests have rarely looked so dazzling.
This is the entrance to the Jungle en voie d’illumination (“Jungle on the way to enlightenment”) exhibition, organised by the National Museum of Natural History in France. It is designed to showcase the unique diversity of the world’s tropical forests through a series of majestic light installations that focus attention on an array of animals and plants.
Adorning the illuminated arch are several works that offer a glimpse of what is in store in the first zone of the tour: India. An Asian elephant, tigers, a black panther, langur monkeys and a reticulated python just a few of the country’s wild inhabitants can be seen within the luminous forest display, some peeking out of its shining leaves.
From there, the exhibition goes on a journey of discovery to the forests of Borneo, New Guinea, the Amazon (the largest of these landscapes and home to 10 per cent of all biodiversity) and Madagascar, before ending in central Africa while also raising awareness of the need to protect these special landscapes and habitats.

272,https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Philippines: World's 'saddest' elephant dies in Manila zoo,"Bittersweet tributes pour in for Mali, who spent more than four decades all by herself.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-67563146,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9636/production/_131845483_gettyimages-1365574831.jpg,2023-11-29T07:27:58Z,"An elephant christened by activists as one of the world's ""saddest"" has died at a Philippine zoo, where she lived almost all her life alone in a pen.
Tributes have poured in for Mali, who was the star attraction at Manila Zoo for four decades and much beloved.
But the lonely plight of the country's only elephant was a long-running concern for animal rights activists. 
One of them was Sir Paul McCartney, who asked authorities to transfer Mali to an elephant sanctuary.
Mali's death on Tuesday was announced in a Facebook video by Manila mayor Honey Lacuna, who said visits to the zoo to see Mali were among her happiest childhood memories.
Last Friday, the Asian elephant was seen constantly rubbing her trunk against a wall, which indicated that she was in pain, the zoo's chief veterinarian Dr Heinrich Patrick Peña-Domingo said.
By early Tuesday, Mali was lying on her side and breathing heavily. Veterinarians administered antihistamines and vitamins but she died later that afternoon. An autopsy found that she had cancer in some of her organs, as well as a blockage in her aorta.
Mali, whose full name is Vishwa Ma'ali, was gifted to former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos by the Sri Lankan government in 1981, when she was 11 months old.Manila Zoo was also home to another elephant, Shiva, who arrived in 1977 and died in 1990. Mali had been the zoo's only elephant since. At the height of the pandemic, the Manila Zoo also served as a vaccination site for children, where Mali kept them entertained.
Animal rights activists criticised the decrepit conditions at Manila Zoo and said its keepers were ill-equipped to provide Mali with proper medical care. Zoo authorities however argued that the elephant was best kept in captivity as she had not known what life was like in the wild.

In a letter to then President Benigno Aquino III in 2012, Sir Paul described footage he saw of Mali in captivity as ""heartbreaking"".
""I am writing to add my voice to the many others who are supporting the transfer of Mali, the lonely elephant currently being held at the Manila Zoo, to a sanctuary in Thailand as soon as possible,"" he said.
Former Smiths frontman Morrissey made a similar written appeal, but Mali remained at Manila Zoo.
""One of the world's saddest elephants has passed away,"" People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said. ""Rest in peace, Mali, you deserve so much more.""
On X, formerly Twitter, different generations of Filipinos recalled how school field trips in Manila would always include a visit to Mali, and lamented the fact that she died alone.
One user recalled her first sight of Mali 11 years ago. ""Seeing Mali walking around, you will feel how lonely this elephant is. It broke my heart... and now it was announced that Mali has died.""
""Sad about Mali, the famous elephant here in the Philippines passing away. Hoping no more elephants will be confined to zoos,"" another X user wrote.
At a press conference on Wednesday, the Manila mayor told reporters that she would ask the Sri Lankan government to donate another elephant to the Philippine capital.
She said Mali's long-time caretakers had been crying over her death, and added that Mali's transfer to a sanctuary was ""never considered"", given the length of her captivity.
""She might seem alone, but she had us beside her,"" Ms Lacuna said in Tagalog, her voice cracking. ""She was the face that greeted everyone who visited Manila Zoo. She is a part of our lives.""",bbc-news,BBC News,Asian Elephant,,,0.2,0.8,"Wildlife, Governance",Other,Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus),English

But 500-day wait times or longer continue to hinder travel to the U.S.  
The State Department confirmed the record-breaking issuance of over 140,000 student visas to Indians. The U.S. embassy and consulates in India said they issued nearly 8 million visitor visas for business and tourism for the recent fiscal year. This is the highest output recorded since 2016. A near-historic 10.4 million non-immigrant visas were granted worldwide.     
India is not alone in its visa dilemma. Wait times for first-time visitor visas in Colombia and Mexico are equally high. The U.S. Travel Association forecasts these delays will cost the industry $12 billion in lost traveler spending this year.
The U.S. State Department has introduced measures to address visa backlogs like waiving interview requirements and extending weekend interviews. Yet, the wait times for visa processing have only been reduced by 100 days for Indian travelers, down from 600 days in March. 
Key Source Market: In the first six months of 2023, over 800,000 Indian travelers went to the U.S., making it America’s second-largest non-North American market after the UK this year.
Indian Travel Recovery to the U.S.: For 2023, the U.S. is expected to welcome 1.4 million Indian travelers, 97% of the pre-pandemic volume. Nearly 60% of Indian travelers came to the U.S. for vacation, business, or a conference in the first six months of this year.
Closer to home, Sri Lanka’s pilot project to offer free 30-day visas to Indian travelers, announced at the end of October, kicked off on Wednesday, and will run until March 31, 2024. 
It is the latest country after Thailand and Malaysia to join in offering easier access for Indians.
Sri Lanka’s TourismRecovery: India is traditionally Sri Lanka’s top inbound tourism market. In October 2023, arrival figures for India topped with over 28,000 or 26 percent with Russian tourists trailing at over 10,000 arrivals as the second largest group. The free tourist visa pilot includes India, China, Russia, Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia, and Thailand.
Sri Lanka’s tourism industry endured a severe blow due to the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by an economic crisis last year. The country welcomed 1 million arrivals by September, the first time since 2019, with the island nation expected to conclude the year with 1.5 million arrivals. 
Madla village, located on the outskirts of the Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh, has been chosen by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for its tourist village upgrade program. 
Initially selected as a UNWTO ‘Best Tourism Village’ for 2023, Madla has now qualified to join the upgrade program, meeting the criteria of preserving local culture and promoting diversity.  
IndiGo will be the first airline to operate flights with visibility as low as 3,600 meters for Airbus and 3,200 meters for ATR fleet at Deoghar Airport. 
Poor Seasonal Visibility: Visual flight rules (VFR) at Deoghar Airport were limited to daylight hours with a visibility requirement of 5,000 meters. The low-cost carrier applied for civil aviation approval for special VFR operations at the airport, as poor visibility above 5000 meters during the winter led to many flight cancellations.
Less Disruption: Deoghar Airport is a hub in the eastern sector of India, connecting the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal. IndiGo’s successful flight validation for special VFR operations will reduce disruptions, especially those caused by adverse weather conditions in winter.

275,,Tamil Nadu,"Tamil Nadu, a state at the southern tip of India, has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Its history and culture are among the oldest in the world, and the region is known for its rich tradition of literature, music, and dance. Created as a state in 1969, Tamil Nadu has since become the sixth most populous state in the Indian Union and has the fifth largest economy of all the Indian states. Why do Tamils throw away and burn old clothes during the annual Pongal festival? Discuss",https://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/tamil+nadu,http://img.tfd.com/TFDlogo1200x1200.png,2023-12-06T05:00:00Z,"Tamil Nadu (/tæmɪlnɑːduː/TAM-il-NAH-doo;   ; Tamil: தமிழ்நாடு; literally ""Tamil Country"") is one of the 28 states of India. Its capital is Chennai (formerly known as Madras), the largest city. Tamil Nadu[5] lies in the southernmost part of the Indian Peninsula and is bordered by the union territory of Puducherry, and the states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. It is bound by the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Nilgiri, the Anamalai Hills, and Kerala on the west, by the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar, the Palk Strait in the south east, and by the Indian Ocean in the south.
Tamil Nadu is the eleventh largest state in India by area and the seventh most populous state. It is the second largest state economy in India as of 2012.[6] The state ranked 6th among states in India according to the Human Development Index as of 2011.[3][7] The state has the highest number (10.56 per cent) of business enterprises and stands second in total employment (9.97 per cent) in India,[8] compared to the population share of about 6 per cent.
The region has been the home of the Tamil people since at least 500 BCE and is currently the only official homeland of Tamils anywhere in the world. Its official language Tamil has been in use in inscriptions and literature for over 3,800 years.Tamil Nadu is home to many natural resources, Hindu temples of Dravidian architecture, hill stations, beach resorts, multi-religious pilgrimage sites and eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[9][10]
History
Prehistory
Archaeological evidence points to this area being one of the longest continuous habitations in India.[11] In Adichanallur, 24 km (15 mi) from Tirunelveli, archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) unearthed 169 clay urns containing human skulls, skeletons and bones, husks and grains of rice, charred rice and celts of the Neolithic period, 3,800 years ago.[12] The ASI archaeologists have proposed that the script used at that site is ""very rudimentary"" Tamil Brahmi.[13] Adichanallur has been announced as an archaeological site for further excavation and studies.[14] About 60 per cent of the total epigraphical inscriptions found by the ASI in India are from Tamil Nadu, and most of these are in the Tamil language.[15]. Virumandi Andithevar, of the Piramalai Kallar community from the Tamil Nadu region of southern India, was identified by the Genographic Project as one of the direct descendants of the first modern human settlers in India. His Y-DNA belongs to Haplogroup C and he carries the M130 marker which defines the first migrants to South East Asia and Australia from the African coast 60,000 years ago; more than half of Australian Aborigines also carry the M130 gene.[16]
Indus valley script between 2000 B.C. and 1500 B.C
The Neolithic people of Tamil Nadu shared the same language family of the Harappan group. Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a Dravidian language.The discovery of a Neolithic stone celt, a hand-held axe, with the Indus script on it at Sembian-Kandiyur in Tamil Nadu is, according to Iravatham Mahadevan, ""Stone axe with Indus Valley script found near Mayiladuthurai,Tamil Nadu was a major discovery because for the first time a text in the Indus script has been found in the State on a datable artefact, which is a polished neolithic celt. He estimated the date of the artefact with the script to be around 1500 B.C.[17]
Early history (Sangam Period 300 BCE - 300 CE)
The early history of the people and rulers of Tamil Nadu is a topic in Tamil sources known as Sangam literature. Numismatic, archaeological and literary sources corroborate that the Sangam period lasted for about six centuries, from 300 BCE to 300 CE. Three dynasties, namely the Chera, Chola and Pandya, ruled the area of present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Chera ruled the whole of present day Kerala and parts of western Tamil Nadu comprising Coimbatore, Karur, Salem and Erode districts from the capital of Vanchi Muthur (thought to be modern day Karur). The Chola dynasty ruled the northern and central parts of Tamil Nadu from their capital, Uraiyur; and the Pandya dynasty ruled southern Tamil Nadu, from capitals at Korkai and Madurai. All three dynasties had extensive trade relationships with Rome, Greece, Egypt, Ceylon, Phoenicia, Arabia, Mesopotamia and Persia. Trade flourished in commodities such as spices, ivory, pearls, beads and gems. Chera traded extensively from Muziris on the west coast, Chola from Arikamedu and Puhar and Pandya through Korkai port. A Greco-Roman trade and travel document, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 60–100 CE) gives a description of the Tamil country and its ports. Between the third and the seventh centuries CE, the three Tamil kingdoms were overwhelmed by the Kalabhras; this is sometimes referred to as the ""Dark Age"" in Tamil history, and little is known of it. The Kalabhras were expelled by the Pallavas and the Pandyas in the sixth century.
Medieval Period (600–1300)
During the Kalabhras' rule Buddhism flourished in the land of the Tamils. The didactic work Naaladiyar was composed during their reign. It consists of moral sayings in the venpa meter, 400 in number in 40 chapters, each by one Buddhist ascetic, according to tradition. Following the tradition of Tamil Buddhism, Naaladiyar emphasises virtues such as control of the senses, Dhamma (Lord Buddha's teaching), renunciation, and other desirable social qualities. Pali was the court language of the Kalabhras who were also called Kalapara or Kalaparaya according to the Koramangalam inscription.
During the fourth to eighth centuries C.E., Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the Pallavas under Mahendravarman I and his son MamallaNarasimhavarman I.[22] The Pallavas ruled a parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. Dravidian architecture reached its peak during Pallava rule. Narasimhavarman II built the Shore Temple which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They came into conflict with the Kannada Chalukyas of Badami. During this period, The great Badami Chalukya King Pulakesi II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the Pallava kingdom and defeated the Pallavas in several battles.[23] Pallava Narasimhavarman, however, reversed this victory in 642 by attacking and occupying Badami temporarily.[24] However, a later Chalukya King Vikramaditya II took revenge by repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava Parameswarvarman I and the temporary occupation of Kanchipuram.[25]
The Pallava dynasty was overthrown in the 9th century by the imperial Rashtrakutas who ruled from Gulbarga. King Krishna III, the last great Rashtrakuta king consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the Narmada River to Kaveri River and included the northern Tamil country (Tondaimandalam) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon.[26] Much later, the Pallavas were replaced by the Cholas as the dominant kingdom in the 10th century C.E. and they in turn were replaced by Pandyas in the 13th century C.E. The Pandyan capital Madurai was in the deep south away from the coast. They had extensive trade links with the south east Asian maritime empires of Srivijaya and their successors, as well as contacts, even formal diplomatic contacts, reaching as far as the Roman Empire. During the 13th century C.E. Marco Polo mentioned the Pandyas as the richest empire in existence. Temples such as the Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai and Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli are the best examples of Pandyan temple architecture.[27] The Pandyas excelled in both trade and literature. They controlled the pearl fisheries along the south coast of India coast, between Sri Lanka and India, which produced some of the finest pearls in the known ancient world.
Chola Empire
The Cholas, who were very active during the Sangam age, were entirely absent during the first few centuries.[28] The period started with the rivalry between the Pandyas and the Pallavas, which in turn caused the revival of the Cholas.
During the ninth century, the Chola dynasty was once again revived by Vijayalaya Chola, who established Thanjavur as Chola's new capital by conquering central Tamil Nadu from the local clans of Mutharayar and the Pandya king Varagunavarman II. Aditya I and his son Parantaka I expanded the kingdom to the northern parts of Tamil Nadu by defeating the last Pallava king, Aparajitavarman.
Parantaka Chola II expanded the Chola empire into what is now interior Andhra Pradesh and coastal Karnataka, while under the great Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas rose to a notable power in south east Asia. Now the Chola Empire stretched as far as Bengal and Sir Lanka. At its peak, the empire spanned almost 3,600,000 km2 (1,400,000 sq mi). Rajaraja Chola conquered all of peninsular south India and parts of Sri Lanka. Rajendra Chola's navy went even further, occupying coasts from Burma (now Myanmar) to Vietnam, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Sumatra, Java, Malaya, Philippines[29] in South East Asia and Pegu islands. He defeated Mahipala, the king of Bengal, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital and named it Gangaikonda Cholapuram.
The Cholas were prolific temple builders right from the times of the first medieval king Vijayalaya Chola. These are the earliest specimen of Dravidian temples under the Cholas. His son Aditya I built several temples around the Kanchi and Kumbakonam regions. The Cholas went on to becoming a great power and built some of the most imposing religious structures in their lifetime and they also renovated temples and buildings of the Pallavas, acknowledging their common socio-religious and cultural heritage. The celebrated Nataraja temple at Chidambaram and the Sri Ranganathaswami Temple at Srirangam held special significance for the Cholas which have been mentioned in their inscriptions as their tutelary deities.
Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola, who built temples such as the Brihadeshvara Temple of Thanjavur and Brihadeshvara Temple of Gangaikonda Cholapuram, the Airavatesvara Temple of Darasuram and the Sarabeswara (Shiva) Temple, also called the Kampahareswarar Temple at Thirubhuvanam, the last two temples being located near Kumbakonam. The first three of the above four temples are titled Great Living Chola Temples among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes all over the world. Among the existing specimens in museums around the world and in the temples of southern India the fine figures of Siva in various forms, Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, and the Siva saints are the examples of Chola bronze. Though conforming generally to the iconographic conventions established by long tradition, the sculptors worked with great freedom in the 11th and the 12th centuries to achieve a classic grace and grandeur. The best example of this can be seen in the form of Nataraja the Divine Dancer.
During the rule of the great Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI, in the late eleventh to early twelfth century, the Western Chalukyas convincingly defeated the Cholas on several occasions, weakening their empire.[30][31] With the decline of the Chola dynasty between 1116 and 1185 C.E., the Hoysalas of Kannada country rose to prominence, under King Vishnuvardhana and his grandson, the celebrated Veera Ballala II.[32][33][34] The Hoysalas extended their foothold in Tamil Nadu around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near Srirangam a provincial capital that give them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan.[35][36] Hoysala Vira Narasimha II's son Vira Someshwara earned the honorific ""uncle"" (Mamadi) from the Pandyas and Cholas. The Hoysala influence spread over Pandya kingdom from who they gained tribute.[37] This revival was short-lived as the Pandya capital of Madurai itself was sacked by Alauddin Khilji's troops under General Malik Kafur in 1316. The Muslim invasion led to the establishment of the short-lived Madurai Sultanate.

Vijayanagar and Nayak period (1336–1646)
The Muslim invasions of southern India triggered the establishment of the HinduVijayanagara Empire with Vijayanagara in modern Karnataka as its capital. The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 C.E. and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates.
Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called Nayaks, succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the Nayaks of Madurai and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom.[27] The Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent of Nayaks in the 17th century. They reconstructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu such as the Meenakshi Temple.
Rule of Nawabs and Nizams (1692–1801)
In the early 18th century, the eastern parts of Tamil Nadu came under the dominions of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Nawab of the Carnatic. While Wallajah was supported by the English, Chanda Shahib was supported by the French by the middle of the 18th century. In the late 18th century, the western parts of Tamil Nadu came under the dominions of Hyder Ali and later Tipu Sultan, particularly with their victory in the Second Anglo-Mysore War.
Early struggle for Independent states
The fall of Nayaka period brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams. Some of these Palaiyakkarar ('polygar' as called by British) were ruling under Nawabs of Carnatic. Nawabs granted taxation rights to the British which led to conflicts between British and the Palaiyakkarar, which resulted in series of wars to establish independent states by the aspiring Palaiyakkarar. Azhagu Muthu Kone (1728-1757) was an Indian revolutionary and independence activist. He is regarded for having raised one of the first revolts against the British East India Company in India. Kone was born and brought up in Kattalankulam, a village in erstwhile Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. Puli Thevar (1715-1767), Palaiyakkara chieftain of Nerkattumseval who fought the British East India Company in the 1750s and 1760s. Vennikkaladi Kudumbar, Thalapathi in Puli Thevar Force chieftain who fought the British East India Company in the 1750s and 1760s. Rani Velu Nachiyar, First Woman Freedom fighter of India and Queen of Sivagangai. She was drawn to war after her husband Muthu Vaduganatha Thevar (1750–1772), King of Sivaganga was murdered at Kalayar Kovil temple by British generals Joseph Smith and Benjour. Before her death, Queen Velu Nachi granted powers to Maruthu brothers to rule Sivaganga. Kattabomman (1760–1799), Palaiyakkara chief of Panchalakurichi who fought the British in the First Polygar War. He was captured by the British at the end of the war and hanged near Kayattar in 1799. Veeran Sundaralingam (1700-1800) was the General of Kattapomman Nayakan's palayam, who died in the process of blowing up a British ammunition dump 1799 which killed more than 150 British soldiers to save Kattapomman Palace. Oomaithurai, younger brother of Kattabomman, took asylum under the Maruthu brothers Periya Marudhu and Chinna Marudhu and raised army. They formed a coalition with Dheeran Chinnamalai and Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja which fought the British in Second Polygar Wars. Dheeran Chinnamalai (1756–1805), Polygar chieftain of Kongu and feudatory of Tipu Sultan who fought the British in the Second Polygar War.
The Vellore Mutiny on 10 July 1806 was the first instance of a large-scale and violent mutiny by Indian sepoys against the British East India Company, predating the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by half a century. The revolt, which took place in the South Indian city of Vellore, was brief, lasting only one full day, but brutal as mutineers broke into the Vellore fort and killed or wounded 200 British troops, before they were subdued by reinforcements from nearby Arcot.
European rule (1801–1947)
Around 1609, the Dutch established a settlement in Pulicat, while the Danes had their establishment in Tharangambadi also known as Tranquebar. In 1639, the British, under the East India Company, established a settlement further south of Pulicat, in present day Chennai. In the late 18th century, the British fought and reduced the French dominions in India to Puducherry. Nizams of Hyderabad and the Nawabs of the Carnatic bestowed tax revenue collection rights on the East India Company for defeating the Kingdom of Mysore. After winning the Polygar wars, the East India Company consolidated most of southern India into the Madras Presidency coterminous with the dominions of Nizam of Hyderabad. Pudukkottai remained as a princely state.
Independent India (1947 - present)
When India became independent in 1947, Madras Presidency became Madras State, comprising present day Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh up to Ganjam district in Orissa, South Canara district Karnataka, and parts of Kerala. The state was subsequently split up along linguistic lines. In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning ""Tamil country"".[38]
Geography
Tamil Nadu covers an area of 130,058 km2 (50,216 sq mi), and is the eleventh largest state in India. The bordering states are Kerala to the west, Karnataka to the north west and Andhra Pradesh to the north. To the east is the Bay of Bengal and the union territory of Puducherry. The southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula is located in Tamil Nadu. At this point is the town of Kanyakumari which is the meeting point of the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean. The south boundary of India is Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu.
The western, southern and the north western parts are hilly and rich in vegetation. The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats and they both meet at the Nilgiri hills. The Western Ghats dominate the entire western border with Kerala, effectively blocking much of the rain bearing clouds of the south west monsoon from entering the state. The eastern parts are fertile coastal plains and the northern parts are a mix of hills and plains. The central and the south central regions are arid plains and receive less rainfall than the other regions.
Tamil Nadu has a coastline of about 910 km (570 mi) which is the country’s third longest coastline. Tamil Nadu's coastline bore the brunt of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami when it hit India, which caused 7,793 direct deaths in the state. Tamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in Zones II &amp; III. Historically, parts of this region have experienced seismic activity in the M5.0 range.[39]
Flora and fauna
There are about 2000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu. Protected areas provide safe habitat for large mammals including elephants, tigers, leopards, wild dogs, sloth bears, gaurs, lion-tailed macaques, Nilgiri Langurs, Nilgiri Tahrs, Grizzled Giant Squirrels and Sambar deer, resident and migratory birds such as cormorants, darters, herons, egrets, Open-billed storks, Spoonbills and White Ibises, Little Grebes, Indian Moorhen, Black-winged Stilts, a few migratory Ducks and occasionally Grey pelicans, marine species such as the Dugongs, turtles, dolphins and Balanoglossus and a wide variety of fish and insects.
Indian Angiosperm diversity comprises 17,672 species with Tamil Nadu leading all states in the country, with 5640 species accounting for 1/3 of the total flora of India. This includes 1559 species of medicinal plants, 533 endemic species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants and 230 red-listed species. The Gymnosperm diversity of the country is 64 species of which Tamil Nadu has four indigenous species and about 60 introduced species. The Pteridophytes diversity of India includes 1022 species of which Tamil Nadu has about 184 species. Vast numbers of bryophytes, lichen, fungi, algae and bacteria are among the wild plant diversity of Tamil Nadu.
Common plant species include the state tree: Palmyra Palm, Eucalyptus, Rubber, Cinchona, Clumping Bamboos (Bambusa Arundinacea), Common teak, Anogeissus latifolia, Indian Laurel, Grewia, and blooming trees like Indian labumusum, Ardisia, and Solanaceae. Rare and unique plant life includes Combretum ovalifolium, Ebony (Diospyros nilagrica), Habenaria rariflora (Orchid), Alsophila, Impatiens elegans, Ranunculus reniformis, and Royal fern.[40]
National and State Parks
Tamil Nadu has a wide range of Biomes extending east from the South Western Ghats montane rain forests in the Western Ghats through the South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests and Deccan thorn scrub forests to tropical dry broadleaf forests and then to the beaches, estuaries, salt marshes, mangroves, and coral reefs of the Bay of Bengal.
The state has a range of flora and fauna with many species and habitats. To protect this diversity of wildlife there are Protected areas of Tamil Nadu as well as biospheres which protect larger areas of natural habitat often include one or more National Parks. The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve established in 1986 is a marine ecosystem with seaweed and sea grass communities, coral reefs, salt marshes and mangrove forests. The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve located in the Western Ghats and Nilgiri Hills comprises part of adjoining states of Kerala and Karnataka. The Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve is in the south west of the state bordering Kerala in the Western Ghats. Tamil Nadu is home to five declared National parks located in Anamalai, Mudumalai, Mukurithi, Gulf of Mannar and Guindy located in the center of Chennai city. Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, Mukurthi National Park and Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve are the tiger reserves in the state. Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve has the largest elephant population in India. Besides these bio reserves, there are many state and central run wild life sanctuaries for tiger, elephant and birds.
Climate
Tamil Nadu is mostly dependent on monsoon rains, and thereby is prone to droughts when the monsoons fail. The climate of the state ranges from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. The state has three distinct periods of rainfall:
<ul><li>advancing monsoon period, south west monsoon from June to September, with strong southwest winds;</li><li>North east monsoon from October to December, with dominant north east winds;</li><li>dry season from January to May.</li></ul>The annual rainfall of the state is about 945 mm (37.2 in) of which 48 per cent is through the north east monsoon, and 32 per cent through the south west monsoon. Since the state is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources, monsoon failures lead to acute water scarcity and severe drought.[41]
Tamil Nadu is classified into seven agro-climatic zones: north east, north west, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and Cauvery Delta (the most fertile agricultural zone). The table below shows the maximum and minimum temperatures that the state experiences in the plains and hills.
Governance and administration
The Governor is the constitutional head of the state while the Chief Minister is the head of the government and the head of the council of ministers. The Chief Justice of the Madras High Court is the head of the judiciary. The present Governor, Chief Minister and the Chief Justice are Konijeti Rosaiah, J. Jayalalitha and M. Y. Eqbal respectively. Administratively the state is divided into 32 districts. It has 10 city corporations, 125 municipalities, 529 town panchayats and 12,524 village panchayats.[42][43]Chennai (formerly known as Madras) is the state capital. It is the fourth largest city in India and is also one of the eight Metropolitan cities of India. The state comprises 39 Lok Sabha constituencies and 234 Legislative Assembly constituencies.
Tamil Nadu had a bicameral legislature until 1986, when it was replaced with a unicameral legislature, like most other states in India. The term length of the government is five years, as is elsewhere in India. The present government run by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)-led alliance came to power in 2011 and consists of a council of 33 ministers, headed by the Chief Minister J. Jayalalitha. The Tamil Nadu legislative assembly is housed at the Fort St. George in Chennai. The state had come under the President's rule rule on four occasions – first from 1976 to 1977, next for a short period in 1980, then from 1988 to 1989 and the latest in 1991.
The local administration is divided into revenue administration and developmental administration. Revenue administrative units are classified based on the district. Each of the 32 districts in Tamil Nadu is divided into divisions, which are further divided to Taluks.[44] Each of these Taluks have a list of revenue villages under them. Tahsildar is the head of these Taluks. Developmental administration, in contrast, is carried out by Panchayat Unions (called blocks) in rural areas. These panchayat unions have a set of panchayat villages under them. In urban areas, the governance is done by municipal corporations, municipalities or town panchayats based on the size of the town.[44] Tamil Nadu has 10 municipal corporations: Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore, Tiruchirappalli, Salem, Tirunelveli, Tirupur, Erode, Thoothukudi and Vellore. Dindigul and Thanjavur are soon going to be upgraded as the next two Municipal corporations.
Tamil Nadu has been a pioneering state of E-Governance initiatives in India. A large part of the government records like land ownership records are digitised and all major offices of the state government like Urban Local Bodies — all the corporations and municipal office activities – revenue collection, land registration offices, and transport offices have been computerised. Tamil Nadu is one of the states where law and order has been maintained largely successfully.[45] The Tamil Nadu Police Force is over 140 years old. It is the fifth largest state police force in India and has the largest strength of women police personnel in the country.[46] As of 2003, the state had a total police population ratio of 1:668, higher than the national average of 1:717. The current Director General of Police (law and order) of Tamil Nadu is K. Ramanujan.[47]

Prior to Indian independence Tamil Nadu was under British colonial rule as part of the Madras Presidency. The main party in Tamil Nadu at that time was the Indian National Congress (INC). Regional parties have dominated state politics since 1916. One of the earliest regional parties, the South Indian Welfare Association, a forerunner to Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu, was started in 1916. The party was called after its English organ, Justice Party, by it opponents. Later, South Indian Liberal Federation was adopted as its official name. The reason for victory of the Justice Party in elections was the non-participation of the INC, demanding complete independence of India.Chempakaraman Pillai, an Indian warrior who attacked the East India Company from the Emden Submarine.

Chidambaram Pillai, Tiruppur Kumaran, Rajagopalachariar (Rajaji) and Satyamurti. The Justice Party which was under E.V.Ramaswamy was renamed Dravidar Kazhagam (DK for short) in 1944. DK was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called Dravida Nadu. However, due to the differences between its two leaders EVR and C.N. Annadurai, the party was split. Annadurai left the party to form the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. In the 19th century, western scholars discovered that the Dravidian languages dominating southern India formed a different linguistic group than the Indo-Aryan languages predominant in northern India. They also classified Indians into distinct Aryan and Dravidian races. It was proposed that the generally darker-skinned Dravidians constituted a distinct race. This concept has affected thinking in India about racial and regional differences and had an impact on aspects of Tamil nationalism, which has appropriated the claim that Dravidians are the earliest inhabitants of India, and the Aryan population were oppressive interlopers from whom Dravidians should liberate themselves.
Post-Independent India
Re-organisation of Indian states according to linguistic and ethnic basis has moderated Tamil nationalism, especially the demand for separation from the Indian Union. The Anti-Hindi agitations in mid-1960s made the DMK more popular and a more powerful political force in the state. The DMK routed the INC in the 1967 elections and took control of the state government, ending INC's stronghold in Tamil Nadu. C.N. Annadurai became the DMK's first Chief Minister. Muthuvel Karunanidhi took over as Chief Minister and party leader after Annadurai's death in 1969. Karunanidhi's leadership was soon challenged by M.G. Ramachandran, popularly known as MGR. In 1972, he split from DMK and formed the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) and later renamed the party as All India Anna Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam. He was the Chief Minister of the state from 1977 until his death in 1987. After the death of MGR, AIADMK was defeated in 1989 assembly polls because of the split of the party into two factions headed by Janaki (wife of MGR) and Jayalalithaa. Later on J. Jayalalithaa took control of the party. She was elected as the General Secretary of the unified AIADMK.

Most early Tamil literary works are in verse form, with prose not becoming more common until later periods. Throughout its history, Tamil literature has sought to inform and inspire, educate and entertain.
Notable examples of Tamil poetry include the Tirukkural, written during the Tamil Sangams period. The poem encompasses a universal outlook, as the author, Tiruvalluvar, does not mention his religion, land, or the audience for his work. He is often portrayed as a holy saint of Tamil Nadu today. Ancient Tamil literature is predominantly secular and deals with everyday life in the Tamil Context.The only religious poems among the shorter poems occur in paripaatal. The rest of the corpus of Sangam literature deals with human relationship and emotions.[73]

Learning is a wealth that none could destroyNothing else gives genuine joy(Tirukkural: 400)

Festivals and traditions
Pongal, also called as Tamizhar Thirunaal (festival of Tamils) or Makara Sankranti elsewhere in India, a four-day harvest festival is one of the most widely celebrated festivals throughout Tamil Nadu.[74] The Tamil language saying Thai Pirandhal Vazhi Pirakkum — literally meaning, the birth of the month of Thai will pave way for new opportunities – is often quoted with reference to this festival. The first day, Bhogi Pongal, is celebrated by throwing away and destroying old clothes and materials by setting them on fire to mark the end of the old and emergence of the new. The second day, Surya Pongal, is the main day which falls on the first day of the tenth Tamil month Thai (14 January or 15 January in western calendar). The third day, Maattu Pongal, is meant to offer thanks to the cattle, as they provide milk and are used to plough the lands. Jallikattu, a bull taming contest, marks the main event of this day. During this final day, Kaanum Pongal – the word ""kaanum"", means 'to view' in Tamil. In 2011 the Madras High Court Bench ordered the cockfight at Santhapadi and Modakoor Melbegam villages permitted during the Pongal festival while disposing of a petition filed attempting to ban the cockfight.[75]

Music
The Kings of ancient Thamizhagam created sangams for Iyal Isai Nadagam (Literature, Music and Drama). Music played a major role in sangams. Music in Tamil Nadu had different forms. In villages where farming was the primary occupation, women who worked in the fields used to sing kulavai songs. Odhuvars, Sthanikars or Kattalaiyars offer short musical programmes in the temples by singing the devotional Thevaram songs. In sharp contrast with the restrained and intellectual nature of Carnatic music, Tamil folk music tends to be much more exuberant. Popular forms of Tamil folk music include the Villuppāṭṭu, a form of music performed with a bow,the urumee mellam or Naiyandi mellam which incorporates the use of the urumee and the Nāṭṭuppur̲appāṭṭu, ballads that convey folklore and folk history.

Thyagarajar Aaradhanai (worship) takes place every year in the month of Marghazhi in Thiruvaiyaru all carnatic musicians render their obesiance to Saint Thyagarajar by singing his compositions. The composers belonging to the Tamil Trinity, namely Muthu Thandavar (?1560 – ?1640), Arunachala Kavi (1712–1779) and Marimutthu Pillai (1717–1787) composed hundreds of devotional songs in Tamil and helped in the evolution of Carnatic music. Chennai hosts a large cultural event, the annual Madras Music Season during December–January, which includes performances by hundreds of artists all over the city.
In terms of modern cine-music, Ilaiyaraaja was a prominent composer of film music in Tamil cinema during the late 1970s and 1980s. His work highlighted Tamil folk lyricism and introduced broader western musical sensibilities to the south Indian musical mainstream. Tamil Nadu is also the home of the double Oscar Winner A.R. Rahman[78][79][80] who has composed film music in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi films, English and Chinese films, was once referred to by Time magazine as ""The Mozart of Madras"".
Arts and dance
Tamils have a large number of folk dances. These are performed for every possible occasion, to celebrate the arrival of seasons, birth of a child, weddings and festivals. Tamil dance is closely intertwined with the Tamil theatrical tradition.
The most celebrated of these dances is the karakattam. In its religious form, the dance is performed in front of an image of the goddess Mariamman. The dancer bears on his or her head a brass pot filled with uncooked rice, decorated with flowers and surrounded by a bamboo frame, and tumbles and leaps to the rhythm of a song without spilling a grain. Karakattam is usually performed to a special type of song known as temmanguppāṭṭu or thevar pāṭṭu, a folk song in the mode of a lover speaking to his beloved, to the accompaniment of a nadaswaram and melam.
Other Tamil folk dances include mayilāṭṭam, where the dancers tie a string of peacock feathers around their waist; ōyilāttam, danced in a circle while waving small pieces of cloth of various colours; poikkal kuthiraiyaaṭṭam, where the dancers use dummy horses; manattam, where the dancers imitate the graceful leaping of deer; paraiyāṭṭam, a dance to the sound of rhythmical drumbeats, and thīppandāṭṭam, a dance involving playing with burning wooden torches.
Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form originating from Tamil Nadu. Prior to the colonial perriod, it used to be performed in Hindu temples by Devadasis. In this form, it as also been called sadir or chinna melam. Many of the ancient sculptures in Hindu temples are based on Bharata Natyam dance postures. Bharatanatyam is a traditional dance-form known for its grace, purity, tenderness, and sculpturesque poses. It continues to be a popular dance style at present times and is practised by male and female dancers all over India.

Kaziranga, Dec 1: A female Greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) was tragically killed in a shocking case of hunting with a spear. The incident has now been resolved, according to park authorities who made the announcement on Friday.
On November 24, 2023, around 8.30 PM, Naren Saikia, a 47-year-old resident of Lokhorakhonia, allegedly threw a spear at the rhino that had strayed into the area. Following investigative work by DFO Eastern Assam Wildlife Division Arun Vignesh and his team, Saikia was arrested and sent to judicial custody on November 26, 2023.
The Kaziranga forest department staff, led by Dr Bibhuti Ranjan Gogoi, Forest Ranger Kaziranga, undertook drone and elephant patrolling surveillance. The rhino’s carcass was discovered on November 30, 2023, at 2.30 pm near the Teteliguri Anti Poaching Camp (Ekorani Area) inside the National Park.
A post-mortem was conducted on December 1, 2023, in the presence of veterinarians and civil society members. The rhino, estimated to be between 20-30 years old, was found to have died from an injury to the left flank of her stomach caused by deep penetration of the spear across her skin and ribs.
Samples have been collected for DNA analysis and for the RhoDIS system and will be sent to the Wildlife Institute of India. The rhino’s horn was intact and has been recovered for safe custody by department staff.",,Thehillstimes.in,Greater One-horned Rhinoceros,,,0.0,1.0,"Wildlife, Governance",Other,Greater One-horned Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis),English

The plug-and-play system is based on the HoutKern Construction Method, utilizing standardized wooden columns and cross-laminated wooden floor panels connected with smart steel joints. This structural framework ensures flexibility in the disposition of additional movable partitions, allowing its users to create interior spaces of different sizes and uses according to their changing needs.
The Wisperweide School is designed around a central auditorium as the main gathering and event space visible from most parts of the school. The learning spaces surrounding the auditorium are divided into two zones, one for toddlers and one for older children. Each zone benefits from a distinct entrance and an outdoor playground. Spacious 3-meter-wide corridors bring natural light into the building, while the modular partitions allow for different configurations of both the classrooms and the corridor spaces. Additionally, the school space can also be expanded outwards, as the existing northern façade can be disassembled and more structural modules can be added
The design of Wisperweide demonstrates the potential of the wooden modular system in creating highly adaptable buildings. As all the structural and technical challenges have been resolved when we developed the system, we can focus on working closely with the school to define the different spatial scenarios that suit its vision and to offer a roadmap to improve the education environment over time. - OMA Managing Partner Architect David Gianotten

Inside the school, the modular framework allows for the integration of different materials and finishes. Biobased partition walls, some 44 centimeters thick, are adapted to provide additional space for lockers, coat racks, and other storage spaces, while others provide an exhibition space for showcasing the pupils work. Wooden elements also define the exterior image of the school. Its façade integrates canopies that mark the main entrances, while the large windows are positioned so that small children can easily look outside.

As the first school to be realized under Amsterdams Innovation Partnership School program, the Wisperweide School strives to meet the programs sustainability conditions by using biobased materials and demountable structures. Circlewoods system is planned to be implemented to build between nine and thirty schools in Amsterdam. The consortium collaborates with young designers, selected by OMA, the Creative Director of Schools by Circlewood. Studio A Kwadraat has been selected as the designer of the first school, and two additional schools have been recently included in the program, De Elementaire School and Het Schoolvoorbeeld.

Synopsis of Mijbil the Otter
The story by Gavin Maxwell is about his pet, an otter, and their journey from Iraq to London via a flight. It further explores the concept of having a different pet and how people reacted to Mij since it was an otter. Get along with the exciting journey of Mijbil and Maxwell and see how they get along so well.
Theme of Mijbil the Otter
The theme of the chapter is the love between a pet and a human being, the bond and attachment between the two, and what a personal loss feels like. Maxwell talks about the loneliness he had to go through after losing his first pet, a dog, and how he could never gather the courage to own a dog again. The story aims to reflect upon the message that every love is important and emotional, and the loss of a pet could really affect an individual leaving him all alone.
The story starts with Maxwell deciding to own an otter instead of a dog, after losing his first pet and feeling lonely since its death. He had a discussion regarding the same matter with a friend and he got the otter in return. The friend had parceled the otter to Maxwell. He had to wait for almost five days at the Consulate General for the parcel, after which two Arab men handed over a sack to him with a note. An otter came out of the sack.
It took some time to adjust to the new surroundings. Initially, Mijbil would sit as far as possible from Maxwells bed but slowly he opened up to him and started sleeping near his knees. Then Maxwell took him to the bathtub and watched him splash water like a hippo. Sooner, he came to know various things related to otters and discovered their love for water. Mij was now getting comfortable with his new home and he would not need the guidance of Maxwell to roam around the house, anymore. Then, Maxwell thought of taking Mij to London. He booked a ticket on a flight where they would allow Mij though under some restrictions. The airline people had asked Maxwell to carry Mij in a box not bigger than 18 inches and he followed the instructions.
In the airplane, he found a sweet air hostess who allowed Maxwell to keep Mij on his lap.  As soon as the box was opened, Mij ran across the aircraft. A lady screamed loud, A rat, A rat and an Indian jumped off from his seat. The air hostess helped Maxwell and brought Mij back to him.
In the last part of the story, Maxwell tells his readers how people would react to seeing Mijbil and call him names for not recognizing the animal. The story ends with a person taking Mij in his hands and asking Maxwell in utter excitement about who Mij is.

""Thailand has historically been a hub for wildlife trafficking, both legal and illegal trade,"" said Steve Galster, founder and CEO of the anti-trafficking organisation Freeland.
""It's got a better infrastructure than other countries in the region so it can get product from source to market, from Africa, from Indonesia to China,"" he told Dave Kendall on the Bangkok Post podcast Deeper Dive.
""So it's just historically placed with a lot of businessmen based in Bangkok, in particular, who know the supply chain and have set them up over decades.""
Which animals are being trafficked? The pangolin was once common in Thailand but now scaly anteaters are being caught in Indonesia and smuggled live across the border with Malaysia and Myanmar.
Dead pangolins, or just the scales prized in Chinese medicine, are shipped from as far away as Africa.
But that's by no means all.
""The list is really long,"" Mr Galster said. ""We've got tiger skins, and bones in particular. We've got other big cats, leopards. We've got lion carcasses being trafficked over from southern Africa. We have wild birds being shipped in all the way from Brazil.""
Wildlife trafficking has three main consequences: first, the suffering of the animals as they are stuffed into crates and bags.
Second, many of the smuggled species are endangered, some critically, and we are in the midst of the worst extinction crisis in history: about 100 species of plants and animals go extinct every day, according to a UN report, and 1 million are on the brink. Habitat loss through the expansion of farming -- mostly for animal agriculture -- is the major cause, but smuggling is another.
Finally, the danger of our own species going extinct is real -- the next pandemic could be much more deadly, and the chance it will be transmitted by zoonotic means (from a chain of animals) is significant.
""Scientists are now saying that what probably sparked Covid-19 was a virus transmitted from raccoon dogs, of all things, from a commercial market in that wet market of Wuhan,"" said Mr Galster.
""Now, those raccoon dogs would have been commercially traded. You can find raccoon dogs in Chatuchak market today. So we should be concerned about all of this.
""I really think we should just be going for a ban on commercial trade in wild animals. I think that there's a tiny percentage of people in the country of Thailand, in the world who actually benefit from that trade. There's a whole lot of people and animals that risk bad things from that trade.""

As I stepped off the helicopter, the overwhelming beauty of the Okavango Delta unfolded beneath me. It was a visual symphony of nature, a place where dreams met reality. My journey with andBeyond in Botswana had begun, and I was about to embark on an adventure that would awaken the eight-year-old boy in me, living out his Indiana Jones and Jungle Book fantasies.
andBeyond Sandibe
The first awe-inspiring moment came swiftly. As our safari vehicle approached a secluded thicket, a majestic pride of lions emerged from the shadows. Their golden coats glistened in the African sun, and I could hardly believe I was this close to these magnificent creatures. The wild echoed with the sound of their soft roars, a memory etched in my mind forever.
andBeyond Sandibe
The surprises kept coming. From my room, perched amidst the lush foliage, I gazed out at a private plunge pool that overlooked the delta. There, like guardian spirits of the wilderness, a group of elephants gracefully strolled by. I watched in silent wonder, feeling as if I had a front-row seat to an intimate gathering of Earth’s most majestic beings.
andBeyond Sandibe
Safari journeys are honest conversations between your adult self and your inner child. As I ventured deeper into the wilderness, I saw hippos with their young, their bulbous forms gently gliding through the delta’s channels. Zebras raced with the wind, their black and white stripes creating a mesmerizing pattern as cheetahs pursued them. It was as if I had stepped into the pages of a storybook, living the tales of my childhood imagination.
andBeyond Sandibe
But it wasn’t just the wildlife that left me in awe. The Okavango Delta gifted us with glorious deep orange sunsets that painted the sky in vivid, breathtaking hues. It was as if the heavens themselves were putting on a show, a daily reminder of nature’s unparalleled artistry.
andBeyond Sandibe
My home during this journey was andBeyond Sandibe, a lodge that seamlessly blended with the natural world around it. Inspired by the elusive pangolin, the architecture of the lodge was a harmonious union of contemporary design and African authenticity. The rooms, reminiscent of weaver’s nests, were nestled in the treetops, providing panoramic views of the delta. I felt like a bird perched high in the branches, my own personal eyrie to observe the theater of the wild.
andBeyond Sandibe
The game drives led by our guides were nothing short of remarkable. Their deep knowledge of the land, as well as their uncanny ability to track the animals, added a layer of excitement and connection to the experience. Every outing felt like a treasure hunt, with each encounter revealing a new and captivating chapter of the delta’s story.
andBeyond Sandibe
What truly set andBeyond Sandibe apart was the warm embrace of the staff and chefs. They made me feel not like a guest, but like a cherished member of the family. Their dedication to hospitality and their passion for the natural world resonated in every smile and every dish they prepared. It was a feeling of being at home, albeit in the heart of the wilderness.
andBeyond Sandibe
In this land of visual wonders, where our memories are drawn from what we see, andBeyond Sandibe was a masterpiece of sight, sound, and sensation. It was an adventure that left me forever changed and inspired. I encourage every traveler, every storyteller, and every adventurer to experience Botswana with andBeyond Sandibe. This, without a doubt, must be on everyone’s bucket list. As a seasoned traveler, I can confidently say that andBeyond Sandibe ranks among my top five must-experience destinations in the world. It’s a place where the line between reality and dreams blurs, where the spirit of adventure thrives, and where the wild calls to the inner child in all of us.

Politics
“So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles
The Constitutional Order
“California struggles to boot Trump” [Politico]. “The window is narrowing to try to knock former President Donald Trump off California’s March 5 primary ballot…. One big question looming over the push to remove Trump from the ballot is the question of who has the authority. Can the top elections officials in each state act unilaterally? Democratic secretaries of state across the country, including those in pivotal swing states like Arizona and Michigan, have largely been skeptical about trying to exert that authority. But Weber hasn’t taken a definitive stance. Her office has repeatedly said she is reviewing the issue…. Eleven Democrats in the California Assembly, led by Assemblymember Evan Low, sent state Attorney General Rob Bonta a letter last month urging him to use his authority to seek an expedited state court ruling. Low said lawmakers are still urging Bonta to act because Trump ‘continues to be a clear and present danger to free and fair elections in the United States.’ Bonta hasn’t publicly responded to the lawmakers’ request. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.”
Biden Administration
“Scoop: Biden administration sending free COVID tests to schools” [Axios]. “The Biden administration for the first time will allow all schools to order free COVID-19 tests from the federal government ahead of the holidays, officials told Axios first…. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), an agency within HHS, has a stockpile of hundreds of millions of COVID tests. It is teaming up with the Department of Education to allow school districts to order tests directly to distribute to families. HHS officials said schools could order tests at a rate they could expect to distribute them, but they did not specify a limit. “I could imagine a situation where perhaps a fifth grade classroom, it has a COVID-positive student and then they send everyone home with a COVID test in the backpack from that fifth grade class,” O’Connell said.” Testing in this scenario is after the fact. #CovidIsAirborne.

“Kamala Harris will attend the COP28 climate summit in Dubai” [Boston Globe]. Well, that’s too bad. I had thought COP28 was important.
“Chances dim for Senate vote on rail safety bill: Consultant” [Freight Waves]. “Prospects for rail safety legislation in Congress to move forward in the waning weeks of 2023 appear dim, given other pressing national issues and even ‘mental exhaustion’* among politicians, according to a former U.S. Department of Transportation official who now heads a consulting firm. ;I think the bottom line is that it’s probably unlikely at this point that we’re gonna see any legislation this year. And next year being an election year is also looking pretty grim as far as prospects for the bill,’ said Loren A. Smith Jr., president of Skyline Policy Risk Group, a research and consulting firm focused on the supply chain. Smith previously served as deputy assistant secretary for policy at DOT.” NOTE * Living with Covid will do that.

“Heavily redacted documents related to search warrant for Trump’s Twitter account released” [New York Post]. “The search warrant, issued in January against the company now known as X, was among several documents released by the Justice Department Monday as part of a lawsuit brought by media organizations seeking sunlight on the special counsel’s investigation into Trump’s actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.” To me, this is the interesting part. From the search warrant: “All information from the Connect’ or Notifications’ tab for the account, including all lists of Twitter users who have favorited or retweeted tweets posted by the account, as well as all tweets that include the username associated with the account (i.e. ‘mentions’ or ‘replies’), the warrant states.” Here is the warrant. Here is the relevant passage:
Note that the warrant limits the seizure to “October 2020 to January 2021.” Nevertheless, if I retweeted a Trump tweet, I could get a visit from the Justice Department? In America? Really?
“Trump Rallies Aren’t Even Really About Politics at This Point” [Slate]. “For all of Donald Trump’s rhetorical innovations, personality quirks, and alleged criminal malfeasance, what has made him truly unique as a political figure is how much he has merged fan culture with American politics. It’s not unusual for Americans to idolize presidentsRonald Reagan and Barack Obama are still actively revered by manybut no other president has inspired the same level of merchandise lines or themed car flags. A MAGA bumper sticker often isn’t simply a statement of loyalty; it’s a cultural signifier of community much like the dancing bear bumper sticker is for a Grateful Dead fan. Nowhere is this more clear than at Trump’s rallies. He’s turned his campaign events into something that has more in common with a Bruce Springsteen concert than a Harry Truman whistle-stop tour. A late-November Trump rally in Fort Dodge, Iowa, was as good an example of the genre as any. Held in a fading blue-collar city about 30 miles from the interstate, attendees started lining up for the rally early in the morning for the chance to see Trump appear in a high school gym decorated with banners celebrating victorious softball and bowling teams…. Trump has long drawn a community of superfans called ‘Front Row Joes’ who treat his events with the same regard that Deadheads used to treat a live show. While Jim and Sandy Pamperin of St. Paul, Minnesota, weren’t quite in that communitySandy had been to a mere eight Trump rallies while Jim had only been to three, including a canceled one in Iowa earlier this yearit was still an important event for them.” 
“I Will Make America Great Again for Young People” [Donald Trump, Newsweek]. “A recent NBC News poll found that we are leading Biden 46 percent to 42 percent nationally among voters ages 18 to 34a clear sign that young Americans are rejecting Joe Biden’s reign of failure, incompetence, and corruption. During the first Trump administration, we created the strongest and most prosperous economy in the history of the world. Under my leadership, annual incomes went up by more than $6,000, inflation was under 2 percent, and we had gasoline down to $1.87 per gallon. Household net worth reached an all-time high, with the bottom 50 percent of American households seeing a 40 percent increase in their net worth. The U.S. economy had never been better for young Americans, but for the past three years, young people have borne the heavy costs of the failed Biden agenda: crippling inflation, soaring prices, skyrocketing interest rates, unaffordable housing, and escalating crime. Over the course of the Biden administration, real incomes have gone down by $7,400 per family. Gas prices reached as high as $7 a gallon in some places. Cumulative inflation is 18 percent. And mortgage rates are pushing a brutal seven percentmaking home ownership out of reach for countless young Americans. When I was in office, the 30-year mortgage rate reached a record low of 2.65 percentand the median-income American family could afford a mortgage. Yet thanks to Biden’s disastrous economy, interest rates have skyrocketed, making home-ownership out of reach for too many Americans, especially young Americans who in previous generations would be looking to start a family. As a result, historically high numbers of young people are delaying marriage and children.” Dunno who the ghostwriter is, but pretty good!

“JPMorgan’s Dimon: Democrats should boost Nikki Haley” [Politico]. “JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon urged Democrats to support Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary, arguing that she offers a strong alternative to former President Donald Trump. ‘If you’re a very liberal Democrat, I urge you to help Nikki Haley, too. Give them a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump,’ Dimon, who leads the country’s largest commercial bank, said onstage at the 2023 DealBook Summit on Wednesday. Dimon has been talking up Haley in recent weeks as the former South Carolina governor has gained in the polls. While she’s still trailing well behind Trump, she has won endorsements from an influential super PAC backed by the Koch network and has started to fundraise with Wall Street heavyweights.” Hey, nimrod: The State is thought to have relative autonomy from the capitalist class. Stay in your lane! (The other squillionaires, too, if it comes to that.)
“Influential GOP donors are betting their millions on Haley in a new push to beat Trump” [CNN]. “The 45th president’s enemies on the right are mustering for a final big money showdown designed to crush his hopes of a third consecutive Republican nomination less than 50 days before voting starts in the GOP primary race. Nikki Haley will be the lavishly funded vessel carrying the hopes of the influential network funded by billionaire Charles Koch and top industrial and corporate donors who think Donald Trump is a risk too far next November.” Not an empty vessel, one hopes….

“How Arab American voters’ backlash could imperil Biden’s 2024 campaign” [Axios]. “Arab American and Muslim American anger over President Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war could be endangering his re-election in the majority of 2024 swing states. Michigan, Virginia, Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania all have notable pockets of these populations. There aren’t reliable statistics on how many are registered voters but even tiny shifts of support in any of these super-tight states that Biden won in 2020 could make a difference…. An Axios review of 2020 results in these crucial states shows that if even a sliver of the Arab American and Muslim American vote were to stay home or defect to Republicans, Biden could be in a deep hole.” Well worth a read (and perhaps the cause of Biden’s recent vibe shift).
“Hunter Biden is finally going to face hard questions from those who won’t ask nicely'” [New York Post]. “‘The Bidens are the best at doing exactly what the Chairman wants.’ Those words from Hunter Biden to a Chinese businessman came at the height of the alleged influence peddling by the Biden family. After years of delay and denials, the House is about to confirm exactly what the Bidens were so good at doing and what foreign figures wanted so much that they were willing to pay the Bidens millions. Hunter Biden is scheduled to appear before the House Oversight Committee on Dec. 13 to answer questions about what is alleged to be the largest influence-peddling operation in history. Despite being subpoenaed, Hunter is still demanding conditions for answering questions. His lawyer Abbe Lowell previously said Hunter would testify only when ‘the time is right’ and is now saying that Hunter would testify in public, not the scheduled private session. Republicans rejected that demand.” As indeed they should!
Democrats en Déshabillé
Patient readers, it seems that people are actually reading the back-dated post! But I have not updated it, and there are many updates. So I will have to do that. –lambert
I have moved my standing remarks on the Democrat Party (“the Democrat Party is a rotting corpse that can’t bury itself”) to a separate, back-dated post, to which I will periodically add material, summarizing the addition here in a “live” Water Cooler. (Hopefully, some Bourdieu.) It turns out that defining the Democrat Party is, in fact, a hard problem. I do think the paragraph that follows is on point all the way back to 2016, if not before:
The Democrat Party is the political expression of the class power of PMC, their base (lucidly explained by Thomas Frank in Listen, Liberal!). 
It follows that the Democrat Party is as “unreformable” as the PMC is unreformable
; if the Democrat Party did not exist, the PMC would have to invent it. If the Democrat Party fails to govern, that’s because the PMC lacks the capability to govern
. (“PMC” modulo “class expatriates,” of course.) Second, all the working parts of the Party reinforce each other. Leave aside characterizing the relationships between elements of the Party (ka-ching, but not entirely) those elements comprise a network — a Flex Net? An iron octagon? — of funders, vendors, apparatchiks, electeds, NGOs, and miscellaneous mercenaries, with assets in the press and the intelligence community.
Note, of course, that the class power of the PMC both expresses and is limited by other classes; oligarchs and American gentry (see ‘industrial model’ of Ferguson, Jorgensen, and Jie) and the working class spring to mind. Suck up, kick down.

Realignment and Legitimacy
“In the world of sexual fetishes, crossing the political aisle is a kink” [WaPo]. “The Democrat, who works in the auto-insurance industry, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears his family finding out about his fetish. He said he discovered political fetishes on a BDSM social media website a couple of years ago. ‘A lot of [the content] was liberals submitting to conservative Republicans or MAGA or being red-pilled’ into supporting and worshiping Trump,’ he said. He got turned on, and it surprised him because ‘
before the Trump era started, I never once thought about politics as being sexualized
,’ he said. ‘Domination from a political party and a[n] ideology that I can’t tolerate, made it way more of a turn-on.;…. Although he has a number of fetishes, this is the one that he considers the most extreme…. It’s not just Democrats fantasizing about being dominated by Republicans. It sometimes works the other way as well. A 60-year-old man, known by his fetish persona Master Black Satyr Dragon Wolf, unexpectedly became a political fetish dominant when a 22-year-old straight-identifying college student responded to his Craigslist ad seeking a BDSM partner. ‘I want to be punished by a person of color because I voted for Donald Trump,’ the student wrote.” And: “Unlike in the non-fetish world, where most Biden and Trump supporters have few friends who vote for the opposing candidate, in the fetish world, political opposites mingle. And if you are into political fetishes you may become, ironically, more open-minded to the opposing side’s views, according to RightMakesMites. ‘If you’re going to effectively dominate them, you have to know kind of why they hate you
. So if you’re sitting there, thinking, Oh, Trump has the answers on everything. How could anyone possibly think otherwise?’ Well, you’re not gonna be a very good dom of a liberal,’ he said.” Wowsers. I dunno (and I’m recalling that liberal Democrats actually dreamed about Trump…).

Covid is Airborne
“Study: Air purifier use at daycare centres cut kids’ sick days by a third” [YLE]. “Use of air purifiers at two daycare centres in Helsinki led to a reduction in illnesses and absences among children and staff, according to preliminary findings of a new study led by E3 Pandemic Response. Air purifiers of various sizes and types were placed in two of the city’s daycare centres during cold and flu seasons. The initial results from the first year of research are promising, according to researcher Enni Sanmark, from HUS Helsinki University Hospital. ‘Children were clearly less sick in daycare centres where air purification devices were used down by around 30 percent,’ Sanmark explained. The air purifiers were changed at two daycare centres serving as a control in the experiment, in order to rule out the effect that possible epidemic fluctuations could have on the results. The study’s next phase will continue until April. ‘We will be able to analyse whether there were only decreases in flu-type illnesses or whether the use of air purification could also help reduce stomach ailments,’ Sanmark said. On average, daycare centre-aged children suffer 10-13 infectious illnesses every year, with each illness lasting from one to three weeks, according to the research.”
Maskstravaganza
Kind words:
I mistrust any form of glorification… but on the whole and on the average, I think Browne’s got it right. Cf. Matt 10:22.
Immnune Dysregulation
“Association of COVID-19 with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in children aged 05 years in the USA in 2022: a multicentre retrospective cohort study” [BMJ]. ” COVID-19 was associated with a significantly increased risk for RSV infections among children aged 05 years in 2022. Similar findings were replicated for a study population of children aged 05 years in 2021. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 contributed to the 2022 surge of RSV cases in young children through the large buildup of COVID-19-infected children and the potential long-term adverse effects of COVID-19 on the immune and respiratory system.” Good thing we forced all our children back into poorly ventilated schools, then….
“COVID-19 and Immune Dysregulation, a Summary and Resource” [World Health Network]. From March, still germane. “The immune system is amazingly complex consisting of T cells, B cells, antibodies, dendritic cells, platelets, and several more cell types. Each type of cell can have numerous subtypes….. In the references attached we see that COVID-19 can affect and damage, at least temporarily, all the aspects and all the cell types of the immune system. It appears to age parts of the immune system, which might be permanent. We simply do not know yet. The effects of COVID-19 are seen in T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and platelets, among other systems.”
“Searching for an explanation about why N.M. pediatric hospitals are overflowing” [Source NM]. ‘Tis a mystery! And the deck: “No one has ruled out that COVID leaves people more susceptible to severe infection.” I should really file this under propaganda: “Numerous medical experts [lol] have said over the past couple weeks that part of the reason is that the public health measures New Mexico took in response to COVID made it so children did not get exposed to respiratory viruses as they normally would have. But in interviews with Source New Mexico, an immunologist and an evolutionary biologist find that explanation to be incomplete, and an explanation could include the fact that COVID attacks the immune system, and like other respiratory viruses, makes a person’s airways more susceptible to infection.” Interesting to see the assault on public health so open.
Variants
The “Pirola” clan:
We've been trying to emphasize that what matters now is not individual variants that will cause ""the next big wave"", but *evolving lineages*. In particular, we noted that, as divergent as it is, stock BA.2.86 (Pirola) would likely not take off, but its *descendants* could.

Infection
“Spare me. If you have a runny nose, stay home” [Sydney Morning Herald]. “The Uber driver coughed. A wet, sickly sound that played on repeat every minute or so, occasionally punctuated by a loud sneeze. He was unmasked, and he’d asked me to shut the rear window so that dust didn’t get into the car. Frankly, I was more concerned with what was already inside it. Every cough made me flinch, and with every sneeze I reflexively touched the straps of my mask, to reassure myself that I was as much as possible protected.” One would think that Uber could devise a corporate policy to prevent this sort of thing. (Also, however, asymptomatic transmission is dangerous, so perhaps all Uber drivers should test….)
Sequelae
“New CDC life expectancy data shows painfully slow rebound from covid” [WaPo]. “The new numbers are clearly positive compared with 2021. But the same data show the dramatic, and protracted, impact of the pandemic. Between 2019 and 2021, life expectancy dropped 2.4 years, and the 2022 jump restored only 1.1. years of that deficit. (Men lost 2.8 years in those first two years, and women 2.1 years.)” And: “Life expectancy rose in a relatively steady fashion for all of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. But starting in 2010, the country entered a decade of stagnation in this key metric.” Thanks, Obama!
“Something Awful”
Lambert here: I’m getting the feeling that the “Something Awful” might be a sawtooth pattern — variant after variant — that averages out to a permanently high plateau. Lots of exceptionally nasty sequelae, most likely deriving from immune dysregulation (says this layperson). To which we might add brain damage, including personality changes therefrom.

 “#CovidIsntOver Trends As Covid-19 Hospitalizations Rise By 8.6%” [Forbes]. “[W]ithout any real national system in place for tracking new Covid-19 cases, the U.S. is sort of flying blind when it comes to SARS-CoV-2 activity. Since emergency room visits and hospitalizations tend to come at least a week or two after people have been infected, rises in such numbers mean that rises in SARS-CoV-2 activity probably occurred two or maybe even three or four weeks prior. And it’s a whole lot harder to prevent an upswing that has already been occurring after the fact, assuming that you don’t have a DeLorean car that serves as a time machine. Basing Covid-19 prevention policies on hospitalizations and deaths alone would be sort of like showing people a burnt down house and saying, ‘Do you think that we need to install some fire extinguishers in this house?'” Indeed.
Case Data
NOT UPDATED From BioBot wastewater data, November 27:
Lambert here: Case counts moving smartly upward (and tinfoil hat time: This is the, er, inflection point CDC was trying to conceal when they gave the contract to Verily and didn’t ensure a seamless transition).
Regional data:
That Midwest near-vertical curve is concerning, although as ever with Biobot you have to watch for backward revisions.
 Lambert here: I’ve looked at Verily’s slick new dashboard, and have some thoughts. But not today!
Variants
NOT UPDATED From CDC, November25:
Lambert here: Top of the leaderboard: HV.1, EG.5 a strong second, but BA.2.86 coming up fast on the outside.
From CDC, November 11:
Lambert here: I sure hope the volunteers doing Pangolin, on which this chart depends, don’t all move on the green fields and pastures new (or have their access to facilities cut by administrators of ill intent).
CDC: “As of May 11, genomic surveillance data will be reported biweekly, based on the availability of positive test specimens.” “Biweeekly: 1. occurring every two weeks. 2. occurring twice a week; semiweekly.” Looks like CDC has chosen sense #1. In essence, they’re telling us variants are nothing to worry about. Time will tell.
Covid Emergency Room Visits
From CDC NCIRD Surveillance, November 25:
Lambert here: Slight increases in some age groups, conforming to wastewater data. Only a week’s lag, so this may be our best current nationwide, current indicator until Verily gets its house in order (and working class-centric, since I would doubt the upper crust goes to the ER).
NOTE “Charts and data provided by CDC, updates Wednesday by 8am. For the past year, using a rolling 52-week period.” So not the entire pandemic, FFS (the implicit message here being that Covid is “just like the flu,” which is why the seasonal “rolling 52-week period” is appropriate for bothMR SUBLIMINAL I hate these people so much. Notice also that this chart shows, at least for its time period, that Covid is not seasonal, even though CDC is trying to get us to believe that it is, presumably so they can piggyback on the existing institutional apparatus for injections.
Hospitalization
Bellwether New York City, data as of November 29:
Up. 
Level-ish, but I bet hospitalization drops over the holiday weekend. Let’s wait and see.
 New York state as a whole looks more like a spike. (I hate this metric because the lag makes it deceptive, although the hospital-centric public health establishment loves it, hospitalization and deaths being the only metrics that matter [snort]).NOT UPDATED Here’s a different CDC visualization on hospitalization, nationwide, not by state, but with a date, at least. November 18:
Lambert here: “Maps, charts, and data provided by CDC, updates weekly for the previous MMWR week (Sunday-Saturday) on Thursdays (Deaths, Emergency Department Visits, Test Positivity) and weekly the following Mondays (Hospitalizations) by 8 pm ET”. So where the heck is the update, CDC? 
Positivity
NOT UPDATED From Walgreens, November 27: 
0.4%. Up. (It would be interesting to survey this population generally; these are people who, despite a tsunami of official propaganda and enormous peer pressure, went and got tested anyhow.)
NOT UPDATED From Cleveland Clinic, November 25:
Lambert here: Increase (with backward revision; guess they thought it was over). I know this is just Ohio, but the Cleveland Clinic is good*, and we’re starved for data, so…. NOTE * Even if hospital infection control is trying to kill patients by eliminating universal masking with N95s.
NOT UPDATED From CDC, traveler’s data, November 6:
Down, albeit in the rear view mirror. And here are the variants for travelers, November 6:
BA.2.86 coming along nicely.
Deaths
Total: 1,183,455 – 
1,183,396
 = 15 (15 * 365 = 5475 deaths per year, today’s YouGenicist number for “living with” Covid (quite a bit higher than the minimizers would like, though they can talk themselves into anything. If the YouGenicist metric keeps chugging along like this, I may just have to decide this is what the powers-that-be consider “mission accomplished” for this particular tranche of death and disease). Lambert here: This number is too small no matter what. Iowa Covid19 Tracker hasn’t been updated since September 27, 2023. I may have to revert to CDC data. Yech.
Excess Deaths
NOT UPDATED The Economist, November 18:
Lambert here: Based on a machine-learning model.

Healthcare
“Causal evidence that herpes zoster vaccination prevents a proportion of dementia cases” (preprint) [medRxiv]. A clever natural experiment. “To provide causal as opposed to merely correlational evidence on this question, we take advantage of the fact that in Wales eligibility for the herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax) for shingles prevention was determined based on an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before September 2 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, while those born on or after September 2 1933 were eligible to receive the vaccine. By using country-wide data on all vaccinations received, primary and secondary care encounters, death certificates, and patients’ date of birth in weeks, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely one week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just one week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the herpes zoster vaccine, there is no plausible reason why those born just one week prior to September 2 1933 should differ systematically from those born one week later…. We then show that receiving the herpes zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of seven years by 3.5 percentage points (95% CI: 0.6 7.1, p=0.019), corresponding to a 19.9% relative reduction in the occurrence of dementia.”

“Americans need an extra $11,400 today just to afford the basics” [CBS]. “The typical American household must spend an additional $11,434 annually just to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed in January of 2021, right before inflation soared to 40-year highs, according to a recent analysis of government data…. Although inflation is cooling, many consumers may not be feeling much relief because most prices aren’t declining (One major exception: gas prices, which are notoriously volatile and which have declined about 5% in the past year.) Consumers are still paying more, albeit at a slower pace, on top of the higher prices that were locked in when price hikes surged in 2022 and earlier this year.” Prices don’t “surge” (note lack of agency). Prices rise because firms raise them.
News of the Wired
“The camel, the rope, and the needle’s eye” [Kiwi Hellenist]. Exegesis of Mark 10:25: “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” So: “According to the myth, camel’ is a misreading: originally, it was a rope’ going through a needle. Still impossible, but not surreal like camel’. Supposedly, the text originally had kamilos, but kamlos camel’ and kamilos rope’ sounded the same in imperial-era Greek, so they got mixed up…. The executive summary is this: the word supposedly meaning rope’ was made up in the 5th century or shortly beforehand, and it was made up specifically to weaken Jesus’ condemnation of wealth.” Vindication of Jesus as surrealist class warrior!
“My $500M Mars Rover Mistake: A Failure Story” [Chris LeWicki]. This is great. “The pulse was sent to the motor. As always, the result was immediate, but this time, alarmingly unfamiliar. The strip chart did not look like anything we had seen before. It did not even look like a broken motor. It was decidedly something else. My mind raced for explanations and in what seemed like an instant, arrived at the most likely explanation. My eyes followed the wires from our breakout box on the test cart to the spacecraft, and the reason for the unfamiliar signal landed like a dagger through my heart. All that power we just released did not go into the RAT-Revolve motor. Due to a mistake I had made with the break-out-box, it went the other direction on the connector interface, sending a surge of electricity straight into the spacecraft, instead of the motor. Ooooohhhh ssshhhhiiiiitttt.” But there’s a happy ending!

283,https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,Climate crisis: Three women helping wildlife survive,"Climate change is a threat to thousands of animal species, including gorillas, pangolins and turtles.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-67308974,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F445/production/_131833526_cp_gladys_kalema_zikusoka_2.jpg,2023-12-01T01:25:18Z,"Discussion of climate change usually focuses on the danger to people, but wildlife is equally affected, if not more so. The crisis is contributing to the risk of extinction of 12,260 threatened species, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently calculated.
Here are three women who dedicate their lives to saving one of those species - the mountain gorilla, the Chinese pangolin and the leatherback turtle.
When Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka began working in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in 1996 the number of mountain gorillas was in sharp decline. But under her care, their fortunes have revived: the population has increased by two-thirds and now stands at 500.
A similar number inhabit the Virunga Mountains, further west, including the Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Kalema-Zikusoka's success is one reason why the mountain gorilla was downgraded from critically endangered to endangered in the 2018 IUCN ""red list"" of threatened species.
But this has not allowed her to relax.
Since 1950, temperatures in Uganda have risen at a rate of nearly a quarter of a degree Celsius per decade, leaving mountain gorillas struggling to quench their thirst. One way they do this is by eating plants with a high moisture level - but these moist plants have been becoming scarce and shifting to different altitudes.
""That could be one of the reasons why they come down to the lower parts of the mountain more often, to people's farms, for banana trunks which have lots of moisture. And that has resulted in increased conflict with farmers,"" Kalema-Zikusoka says.
She and her team are now working on expanding the area of the national park, by buying more land from farmers, so that the gorillas can freely move further up or down the mountains in search of food and water.
Media caption, Climate change: Saving Uganda's mountain gorillas
It was while she was a student at the Royal Veterinary College in London, in the 1990s, that Kalema-Zikusoka began her work on apes, and learned that they were threatened by loss of habitat and human-borne diseases.
She met her first mountain gorilla, named Kacupira, while carrying out field work.
""He was very calm and accommodating and when I stared into his deep brown eyes, I felt a deep connection,"" says the 53-year-old, who now lives in Entebbe, not far from the national park.
Soon after graduating she became Uganda's first wildlife vet, working with Uganda National Parks, which later became the Uganda Wildlife Authority.
As climate change has accelerated, the spread of human diseases to the gorilla population has increased.
This is partly a result of higher temperatures, but also of drought, because in their search for water humans are reaching deeper into the national park, and exposing apes to their illnesses.
Gorillas have caught scabies, giardia (a parasite that causes diarrhoea), intestinal worms and respiratory diseases including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from humans.
The team therefore constantly carries out tests on gorilla faeces to check on their health.
""If we find any alarming infection, we make sure the gorillas are treated,"" she says.
There are now concerns that gorillas could be infected by malaria, which is increasingly common in the human population as a result of climatic changes and growing numbers of mosquitoes.
Kalema-Zikusoka's organisation, Conservation Through Public Health, helps community health workers to reach homes in villages around the national park. Her mantra is ""one health"" - in other words, keeping both humans and gorillas healthy, so that they don't infect each other. 
""We believe if people are healthy so will the gorillas be.""
As a zoology student in Kathmandu in 2008, Tulsi Suwal used to attend classes carrying her son, then a toddler, on her back. 
One day, as she was doing field work outside the city, she saw an animal doing the same thing - it was a Chinese pangolin, one of eight species of the scaly nocturnal mammal. 
""It was doing just what I used to do then,"" says Suwal. ""It was a life-changing experience, and I decided to focus on this species."" 
Image caption, Tulsi Suwal says fires make pangolins vulnerable to poachers and predators
Conservation organisations say pangolins are the most poached animal in the world. This is mainly because their scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine, though some are also eaten. 
But now this species, categorised as critically endangered in the IUCN red list, is also threatened by climate change. 
In the foothills of the Himalayas, the danger comes from forest fires. Now more frequent and more intense, they destroy ground vegetation and parch the earth, which kills the ants and termites that pangolins survive on. 
Smoke from the fires also penetrates the pangolins' burrows, forcing them out into the open even in daytime. 
""And that is when they are either poached or easily fall prey to predators,"" says Suwal. 
Image caption, Dry leaves serve as fuel for fires, which may smoke pangolins out of their burrows
The Small Mammals Conservation and Research Foundation, which she founded, therefore focuses on preventing forest fires wherever pangolins are found in Nepal. 
Measures include creating fire lines - strips of vegetation-free land that prevent fires from spreading - and replacing some broadleaved trees with native conifers so fewer dead leaves accumulate on the ground. 
""We are also helping local communities with technology and finance to collect dry leaves and turn them into compost that they can use in farming,"" says Suwal. 
Refilling dried-out ponds, through canals linked to nearby rivers or other water resources has also helped contain forest fires while giving pangolins valuable access to drinking water. 
All this has helped to keep forest soil moist, which ensures pangolins find ants and termites to eat.
For farmers, pangolins do useful work to keep these pests in check, so local communities are increasingly supporting Suwal's measures.
""They are such harmless animals. They just curl up like a ball when they feel threatened, but they can't protect themselves from the impacts of climate change,"" says Suwal. 
As Pacific islanders face an existential threat from rising sea levels, Anita Posola has an additional worry: how to prevent leatherback turtle eggs getting washed away from the beaches of the Solomon Islands. 
The IUCN red list categorises the species as vulnerable rather than endangered at a global level, but the sub-population in the Western Pacific has shrunk by 80% in recent decades, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Getting tangled up in fishing gear or deliberately caught by humans for food remain the biggest dangers to the leatherback turtle, but storm surges and rising sea levels are an increasing hazard. 
It's important that mother turtles nest above the high-tide mark to prevent their eggs being inundated or washed away, but that mark is now constantly rising.
""This is all very sad. I want to revive their population so that my children are able to see them around in the future,"" says Posola, a ranger at the Haevo Khulano conservation area in the Solomon Islands.
So when she and her team notice that turtles have nested below the high water mark, they dig into the sand to rescue the eggs and move them to a safer place.
""But knowing where the turtles have nested is the key, and that becomes a major challenge during night shifts, or when the weather is bad,"" says the 32-year-old.
As a child she wanted to be a nurse, and says that her current role isn't so very different.
""I may not be a nurse, but working in turtle hatcheries, protecting eggs and baby turtles being born feels a little bit like nursing.""
Image source, Justine Hausheer?TNC
Image caption, Leatherback turtles climb the beach to lay their eggs at night
Last November, however, one of the hatcheries provided less protection for the eggs than Posola had hoped. A storm surge combined with a high tide swept over the top of it, and destroyed most of the eggs. 
""This was the highest point of the sea beach. We can't relocate the nests any further,"" Posola says.
Her team then built a defensive barrier with sandbags, which has so far kept the hatchery dry.
Rising temperatures are another problem, as warmth influences the sex of the turtle hatchlings. If the surrounding sand is above 31.0C (88.8F) the young will hatch as females, according to the NOAA, while if it is below 27.7C they will be male. Between the two extremes the result will be a mixture of both sexes.
The danger is that in a warming world male turtles will become a rarity, leading to a population collapse.
For this reason, hatcheries are positioned in an area of partial shade, which results in cooler sand.
But measuring and maintaining accurate nest temperatures has been a challenge, and the rangers are working with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), an international conservation organisation, to install the right equipment. 
Thanks to the rangers, annual nest numbers of the leatherback turtles in Posola's conservation area have more than tripled in 10 years, the TNC says, while the relocation of nests saves the lives of more than 3,000 hatchlings every year. 
Anita Posola is proud that so much is being achieved - and often, these days, by women. 
""Until a few years ago, rangers on the island used to be only men,"" she said.
""But now we have an all-women rangers' team working day and night.""

284,Roxanne Hoorn,"The Adventures and Trials of Jack, Scat-Sniffing Superdog","Jack and his handler Colette Yee found challenges, meaning, and each other in their work helping scientists better understand orcas, bats, and more. Jack, a stocky cattle dog with a graying face that blends into his blue, mottled coat, struts down the mossy trails of western Oregon with purpose. On or off leash, his focus is keenly attuned to his handler and partner, Collette Yee. And it’s not just the yellow dog toy in her hands that draws his attention. The two can read each other's most subtle cues, and have an unbreakable bond built on years of expert training, mutual reliance, and time together in the field.
For the past six years, Yee and Jack have been nearly inseparable in life and work. They are a part of Rogue Detection Teams, a Washington-based company that focuses on harnessing the unique skills of often unruly and unwanted pets to assist in conservation field research. These dogs are extensively trained to sniff out things far beyond human senses: from bats that hide in crevices to viruses that infect plants, from carcasses frozen deep in snow to all manner of scat. It’s a lot of “stinky data,” says Jennifer Hartman, cofounder of Rogue. Yee and Jack have become well known in the conservation detection dog world for the feats they’ve achieved. They’ve bounded through feet of snow, huddled in the car at night to keep warm in the single digits, traversed rocky ridge lines so narrow that Yee had to carry Jack, and boarded boats and helicopters all over the country and beyond. But this is more than a handler and a working animal. They found home in each other, and ultimately saved one another's lives.
“Jack is always going to have a special spot in my heart,” says Heath Smith, Rogue’s cofounder and a cat-lover–turned–cattle-dog-softie, who has been working in dog detection for 23 years. “I am so incredibly thankful that he met Collette, for everything she's done for him, with everything he's been through. It’s just incredible. I wish for all of the dogs that we have in our care to have somebody as amazing as Collette.”

On the Scent
Yee’s and Jack’s paths didn’t cross until 2017, but the roads they had traveled weren’t all that different, Yee says in reflection. Jack, like many Rogues, was a poorly behaved pup who spent time in and out of Washington animal shelters. Yee, who grew up in California, was a bit of a restless child herself. They were, she says, both bored and aimless. “I didn't have a lot of aspirations,” she says. “I wasn't like the kid that thought about being an astronaut when I grew up. I don't think I had any idea what I wanted to do.”
At the College of San Mateo, California, Yee found a calling in environmental sciences aboard a boat in the Bay. She preferred field work to the stuffy confines of a classroom. Eventually she transferred to the University of California, Berkeley to study bees. “All of a sudden, I was interested in school and I was getting perfect grades,” she says.
Yee graduated in 2014, but a research job was elusive. Then, a friend pointed out Conservation Canines. The company was the predecessor to Rogue and started in 1997 out of the University of Washington, inspired by the narcotic dog training tactics used by the Washington State Department of Corrections. It was one of the first canine conservation research programs of its kind, though the practice can be dated back to the 1890s, when conservationist Richard Henry in New Zealand taught his pet dog to find rare bird species for protection. Since then, canines have been used around the world to sniff out anything from pangolin and leopard poo to the traces of silverspot butterfly caterpillars. Dogs have accomplished what human researchers fail or struggle to alone, finding minute details—often in the form of data-rich feces—across vast landscapes.

Yee applied immediately. Nothing, but she couldn’t get the idea out of her mind. She quit a service job and started working at a kennel. A year passed before applications reopened. The company was just six people, but was looking for new recruits. So Yee made a flashy video application—complete with a song and a photo montage of her passions and achievements. Her dark hair was pulled back and she wore a simple silver nose ring. She smiled into the camera and sang, as photos of her decked out in rugby gear, hoisting a pack at a trailhead, taking field notes, and—of course—training dogs, flicked across the screen. “Her application is single-handedly one of the best we have ever received, then or now,” says Hartman, who worked at Conservation Canines along with Smith.
Yee had two weeks to pack up and drive to the remote station in Washington. She arrived with eight other eager candidates, and the real test began—a grueling screening process. “Finding the dogs and working with them is the easy part,” says Smith. “Finding people that can work with those dogs is the hard part.” The first week they spent hiking from sunup to sundown, with no dogs in sight. “Most people don't realize how hard it is,” Yee says. “We're hiking off trail; we're hiking all day long. The dogs are the easy part. The dogs know what they're doing. It's more like, can you keep up with them?”

Meet the Rogues
“They're not your normal dogs, and this isn't your normal job,” says Smith. Rogue dogs are a special kind of naughty. They’re hard to keep as pets, and adopting these problem dogs for field work is intentional, says Hartman. “A huge part of why we do this work is because this is a resource for the unwanted dogs of the shelter world,” she says: high energy, ill-behaved, and, most importantly, fetch-obsessed. Like really obsessed, says Yee.
The new recruits paired off and tried out different dogs—from cattle dogs to chihuahua mixes to schipperkes. Some matches were obvious. Ranger, a big black lab with boundless energy, teamed up with an ultramarathon runner, of course. All the dogs had their strong suits, from attention to tiny details to mastery of difficult terrain. However, there was one dog so difficult that none of the new recruits—and few of the old—were interested in teaming up. Jack, a sturdy speckled cattle dog with a lolling tongue and big smile, was cute, but had a reputation for stubbornness and even aggression.

Despite being at Conservation Canines for years, Jack had yet to find a human partner outside of Smith, who is a virtual dog whisperer. “Yeah, he never found his person because he was a jerk,” Yee says. Jack often just took off. Or, during training, he’d skip samples or refuse to move from ones he’d already found. “I would call my friends back home and say, ‘Ugh I don’t want to work with this dog,’” says Yee.
Smith put Jack and Yee together for a real assignment. The study involved traversing a 1,776-square-mile area, twice, and focused on identifying signs of big carnivores, such as pumas, bears, and bobcats. The dogs’ job was a classic: sniff out scat in return for a round of fetch or tug-of-war. “There is no way this is going to work,” Yee remembers thinking. But when they hit the field, something happened. “He was a completely different dog,” says Yee. “The thing Jack and I discovered really quickly on our first trip is that he is just so easily bored. He needs mental and physical stimulation all the time, or he just loses his mind.” Suddenly, the work made total sense to Yee. “It was like night and day,” she says. “All of a sudden, I was like, ‘Okay, I get it now.’ These dogs need to be out here. Jack truly hates not working. This is why these people do this, these dogs need it.”

A Destined Duo
Yee was hooked, not just on the job, but on her new partner. “After that first study we went everywhere together,” she says. Their next mission was to sniff out oily and elusive orca scat on the Salish Sea. Jack stood proudly on the bow of the boat, like a mermaid figurehead. Yee crouched over him, like a parody of that bow scene from Titanic. “It’s almost exactly the same thing you do on land, except now the dog doesn't have legs, and you have to be the legs for them,” she says.
Yee watched Jack's face carefully. A lean of the body or a simple flair of one nostril was enough for her to tell the captain to change course. “When he picks up an odor he makes a different face,” says Yee, vaguely imitating him. “He'll get serious and his eyes will narrow, and he’ll kind of taste the air.” The operation was a well-oiled machine, with Jack silently relaying information to Yee, who used hand signals to keep the captain in the loop. Time after time they found the scat and could take their samples, which are critical for understanding of orca population health.

“You can get any information you can think of,” says Yee of the scientific value of orca feces. “It's like the same thing as going to your doctor. You can get a really intimate view into their lives.” Over years of this kind of sampling, it was revealed that 69 percent of pregnancies in this dwindling resident population ended in miscarriage due to a lack of food and the metabolizing of old toxins stored in the fat of the starving whales. The findings were dark but important, and Jack became a local celebrity for his work.
The next two years were full of nearly nonstop adventure for the duo, from tracking hawks along Wyoming’s snow-covered highways to leading investigators to bat and bird carcasses in California’s wind turbine fields. In 2019, they faced their greatest challenge yet. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game had spent years trying to track the state’s small brown bats—who cozy up in small groups or all alone in cavities between rocks—to their tiny hibernation sites, with little success. Even their tiny satellite trackers went dark in the bats’ dens. Using a combination of acoustic sensors and cameras, the researchers narrowed in on some prime hibernation areas, but identifying actual roosts was a seemingly impossible challenge. Dog detection is used for bat studies, but no one had been able to train a dog on this specific, tricky task: sniffing out where bats had touched down, maybe hours or days before.
Jack's work has taken him aboard boats and helicopters, where he needs a little extra protection to stay calm. Collette Yee

Each new project, each new scent, requires a new round of training. Jack got used to dead bats, guano, and bits of bat fur on a fishing line dragged over rocks. But samples like these can pick up a lot of other scents along the way, and don’t always equate to what the dogs will be trying to find out in the wilderness. “An important element of any new scent [training] is getting a ‘hot spot,’” Yee says. “We need to bring them to a place that we already know has it, and then when they get that very first wild sample, that’s when things click.”
They let Jack sniff a live bat and then helicopter-lifted him to rocky ridgelines where bats were known to have been scouting out homes. The crew spent a week trying out spots, but Jack wasn’t responding. “He wasn't showing any interest and was just like, ‘Whatever, there's nothing here,’” says Yee.
Then, suddenly, Jack lit up. He sniffed up the length of a rock, turned to Yee and sat down—the indication that he had found what he was trained to find. “I could literally see the light go on,” says Yee. The research team pulled the SD card from a nearby camera trap. Sure enough, the footage showed a bat crawling the exact path Jack had traced. And the footage was two days old. They tried again, circling the spots Jack signaled with chalk and setting up camera traps. Again and again they’d watch bats land bullseye in the chalk circle. “I had never been so proud of him,” says Yee with a big grin.

The Fight to Live
Just when the two seemed indestructible, everything went off the rails. “Jack and I are inseparable, right?” says Yee, her grin fading and her eyes wandering. “We think nothing's gonna tear us apart. And then, the one thing that could get us away from each other does.”
In spring 2020, Yee got the worst phone call of her life. Her sister—just a year older, but a role model and caretaker—had died, just a week after Yee’s last visit. “It just destroys my whole life,” says Yee. In shock, Yee left Jack in the care of the Rogue team and went home to the Bay. She spent the next year alone, in a blur, during a pandemic, not working and hardly mustering the inspiration to leave the house, until one day, she got another call. It was about Jack.
Jack was out of the field, and had been diagnosed with apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma—a form of cancer. “A year after my sister's death, I'm still just a shadow of myself and hearing about Jack,” Yee says, “it gave me the kick in the ass I needed.” Yee drove up to Washington, picked up Jack, and headed to Oregon to start a new life together. Jack was once again the center of her world, someone to live for, she says.

Over the next year Jack went through a series of surgeries, followed by remission and recurrence. Finally, the only option was aggressive and expensive rounds of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy. Yee questioned whether she could put Jack through anymore, let alone how she or Rogue could ever afford the treatments. “This dog literally saved my life and gave me everything,” she says, so they pooled what they could, borrowed, and crowdfunded the rest.
Amazingly, the aggressive treatment seemed to work. “I could see it in him almost immediately,” says Yee, her smile returning. “His energy was up. His appetite was up, everything like he was. He looked completely different after all these treatments.” Jack is still on chemotherapy, which he can now take orally, and goes in for regular testing, but he is technically in remission. As Jack became healthier, his personality returned; he got restless. “He's driving me nuts,"" says Yee. ""You wouldn't even think that this kid has cancer, because he just wants to go.”


""This dog literally saved my life and gave me everything.""




In spring 2023, shortly after his 11th birthday, Jack was back in his happy place—at work. Yee broke down in tears, overwhelmed with the joy of watching Jack back at it, sniffing for squirrels in the woods of Washington. “It was just such the right choice to put him back in the field,” says Yee.
“To see the two of them actually back in the field working, I honestly didn't think it would have been possible,” says Smith, who recently lost one of his own dogs to the same cancer.
As much as Yee took care of Jack during his illness, he was helping her, too. “Having him back in my life and remembering how much love I had for him, really changed a lot,” says Yee. “In my mind for that year, I didn’t care about anything. I lost the person who essentially raised me and gave me everything that I have. I needed that reminder. In a really fucked up way, Jack’s cancer saved me.”

A New Chapter
With two new leases on life, Yee and Jack are focusing on slowing down from the years on the go. Yee’s career gave her a sense of purpose, but she can’t help but think of all she missed out on. “I was always on the road, months gone, never seeing my friends and family, not having a life outside of work,” she says. “All I did was work. But now, I can do it differently. This time around, I can put down roots in a city and do it how I want to.” That doesn’t mean Yee is done with Rogue. She’s still in the field occasionally—especially if Jack has a say in it—and the pair is also focusing on much-needed consulting and education for the rapidly expanding world of canine detection research, which is itself at a kind of crossroads.
“We are seeing such a huge increase in the popularity of this method, which on the one hand is wonderful—more dog teams helping wildlife, right?” says Hartman. “But with this rise comes the caveat that if we as a field are not developing it ethically or sustainably, we could see the collapse of something fragile.” People with pet dogs are starting to saturate the field, for example, and these enthusiasts offer up cheaper or free canine services, without formal, rigorous training. If they muddy the reputation of the research method, Hartman, Smith, and Yee, say, then there’s one less place for dogs like Jack.
Now Yee is crafting a new life in Oregon with Jack, her pet dog Riley, and occasionally Dio, her other Rogue partner. But she still has plans for adventure. Her next project is helping a canine team in Hawaiʻi learn to sniff out invasive snails. And the Rogue team is just glad to have her back. “We just don't come across folks like Collette with her skills,” says Smith. “And not just with the dogs, but her skills at doing anything. Having her come back in any capacity is fantastic for us. Honestly, even if she wasn't working with us, just to have her come for the holidays is very special. Just to be around her is fantastic.” Jack seems to feel the same way.",https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/conservation-canines-handlers,https://img.atlasobscura.com/L55A_1-ca-F7LKqL03WM-n1OEqr10WePkmWpX12CDqg/rt:fit/w:600/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy9mNmQyZTRmZi0w/ZTc2LTQxNDMtOTM3/Ny0xZDU0OWUzMjJm/ZTczZTdmYWRiNGNl/MjJiZDY3OWZfMjAy/MEZlYnJ1YXJ5OS1I/b2xseSBDb29rIFBo/b3RvZ3JhcGh5Lmpw/Zw.jpg,2023-12-01T20:25:00Z,"Jack, a stocky cattle dog with a graying face that blends into his blue, mottled coat, struts down the mossy trails of western Oregon with purpose.

The company was just six people, but was looking for new recruits. So Yee made a flashy video application—complete with a song and a photo montage of her passions and achievements. Her dark hair was pulled back and she wore a simple silver nose ring. She smiled into the camera and sang, as photos of her decked out in rugby gear, hoisting a pack at a trailhead, taking field notes, and—of course—training dogs, flicked across the screen. “Her application is single-handedly one of the best we have ever received, then or now,” says Hartman, who worked at Conservation Canines along with Smith.
Yee had two weeks to pack up and drive to the remote station in Washington. She arrived with eight other eager candidates, and the real test began—a grueling screening process. “Finding the dogs and working with them is the easy part,” says Smith. “Finding people that can work with those dogs is the hard part.” The first week they spent hiking from sunup to sundown, with no dogs in sight. “Most people don’t realize how hard it is,” Yee says. “We’re hiking off trail; we’re hiking all day long. The dogs are the easy part. The dogs know what they’re doing. It’s more like, can you keep up with them?”

Meet the Rogues
“They’re not your normal dogs, and this isn’t your normal job,” says Smith. Rogue dogs are a special kind of naughty. They’re hard to keep as pets, and adopting these problem dogs for field work is intentional, says Hartman. “A huge part of why we do this work is because this is a resource for the unwanted dogs of the shelter world,” she says: high energy, ill-behaved, and, most importantly, fetch-obsessed. Like really obsessed, says Yee.
The new recruits paired off and tried out different dogs—from cattle dogs to chihuahua mixes to schipperkes. Some matches were obvious. Ranger, a big black lab with boundless energy, teamed up with an ultramarathon runner, of course. All the dogs had their strong suits, from attention to tiny details to mastery of difficult terrain. However, there was one dog so difficult that none of the new recruits—and few of the old—were interested in teaming up. Jack, a sturdy speckled cattle dog with a lolling tongue and big smile, was cute, but had a reputation for stubbornness and even aggression.

Despite being at Conservation Canines for years, Jack had yet to find a human partner outside of Smith, who is a virtual dog whisperer. “Yeah, he never found his person because he was a jerk,” Yee says. Jack often just took off. Or, during training, he’d skip samples or refuse to move from ones he’d already found. “I would call my friends back home and say, ‘Ugh I don’t want to work with this dog,’” says Yee.
Smith put Jack and Yee together for a real assignment. The study involved traversing a 1,776-square-mile area, twice, and focused on identifying signs of big carnivores, such as pumas, bears, and bobcats. The dogs’ job was a classic: sniff out scat in return for a round of fetch or tug-of-war. “There is no way this is going to work,” Yee remembers thinking. But when they hit the field, something happened. “He was a completely different dog,” says Yee. “The thing Jack and I discovered really quickly on our first trip is that he is just so easily bored. He needs mental and physical stimulation all the time, or he just loses his mind.” Suddenly, the work made total sense to Yee. “It was like night and day,” she says. “All of a sudden, I was like, ‘Okay, I get it now.’ These dogs need to be out here. Jack truly hates not working. This is why these people do this, these dogs need it.”

A Destined Duo
Yee was hooked, not just on the job, but on her new partner. “After that first study we went everywhere together,” she says. Their next mission was to sniff out oily and elusive orca scat on the Salish Sea. Jack stood proudly on the bow of the boat, like a mermaid figurehead. Yee crouched over him, like a parody of that bow scene from Titanic. “It’s almost exactly the same thing you do on land, except now the dog doesn’t have legs, and you have to be the legs for them,” she says.
Yee watched Jack’s face carefully. A lean of the body or a simple flair of one nostril was enough for her to tell the captain to change course. “When he picks up an odor he makes a different face,” says Yee, vaguely imitating him. “He’ll get serious and his eyes will narrow, and he’ll kind of taste the air.” The operation was a well-oiled machine, with Jack silently relaying information to Yee, who used hand signals to keep the captain in the loop. Time after time they found the scat and could take their samples, which are critical for understanding of orca population health.

“You can get any information you can think of,” says Yee of the scientific value of orca feces. “It’s like the same thing as going to your doctor. You can get a really intimate view into their lives.” Over years of this kind of sampling, it was revealed that 69 percent of pregnancies in this dwindling resident population ended in miscarriage due to a lack of food and the metabolizing of old toxins stored in the fat of the starving whales. The findings were dark but important, and Jack became a local celebrity for his work.
The next two years were full of nearly nonstop adventure for the duo, from tracking hawks along Wyoming’s snow-covered highways to leading investigators to bat and bird carcasses in California’s wind turbine fields. In 2019, they faced their greatest challenge yet. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game had spent years trying to track the state’s small brown bats—who cozy up in small groups or all alone in cavities between rocks—to their tiny hibernation sites, with little success. Even their tiny satellite trackers went dark in the bats’ dens. Using a combination of acoustic sensors and cameras, the researchers narrowed in on some prime hibernation areas, but identifying actual roosts was a seemingly impossible challenge. Dog detection is used for bat studies, but no one had been able to train a dog on this specific, tricky task: sniffing out where bats had touched down, maybe hours or days before.
Jack’s work has taken him aboard boats and helicopters, where he needs a little extra protection to stay calm. Collette Yee
Each new project, each new scent, requires a new round of training. Jack got used to dead bats, guano, and bits of bat fur on a fishing line dragged over rocks. But samples like these can pick up a lot of other scents along the way, and don’t always equate to what the dogs will be trying to find out in the wilderness. “An important element of any new scent [training] is getting a ‘hot spot,’” Yee says. “We need to bring them to a place that we already know has it, and then when they get that very first wild sample, that’s when things click.”
They let Jack sniff a live bat and then helicopter-lifted him to rocky ridgelines where bats were known to have been scouting out homes. The crew spent a week trying out spots, but Jack wasn’t responding. “He wasn’t showing any interest and was just like, ‘Whatever, there’s nothing here,’” says Yee.
Then, suddenly, Jack lit up. He sniffed up the length of a rock, turned to Yee and sat down—the indication that he had found what he was trained to find. “I could literally see the light go on,” says Yee. The research team pulled the SD card from a nearby camera trap. Sure enough, the footage showed a bat crawling the exact path Jack had traced. And the footage was two days old. They tried again, circling the spots Jack signaled with chalk and setting up camera traps. Again and again they’d watch bats land bullseye in the chalk circle. “I had never been so proud of him,” says Yee with a big grin.

The Fight to Live
Just when the two seemed indestructible, everything went off the rails. “Jack and I are inseparable, right?” says Yee, her grin fading and her eyes wandering. “We think nothing’s gonna tear us apart. And then, the one thing that could get us away from each other does.”
In spring 2020, Yee got the worst phone call of her life. Her sister—just a year older, but a role model and caretaker—had died, just a week after Yee’s last visit. “It just destroys my whole life,” says Yee. In shock, Yee left Jack in the care of the Rogue team and went home to the Bay. She spent the next year alone, in a blur, during a pandemic, not working and hardly mustering the inspiration to leave the house, until one day, she got another call. It was about Jack.
Jack was out of the field, and had been diagnosed with apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma—a form of cancer. “A year after my sister’s death, I’m still just a shadow of myself and hearing about Jack,” Yee says, “it gave me the kick in the ass I needed.” Yee drove up to Washington, picked up Jack, and headed to Oregon to start a new life together. Jack was once again the center of her world, someone to live for, she says.
Yee made art of Jack for stickers to help raise funds for his cancer treatment. Collette Yee
Over the next year Jack went through a series of surgeries, followed by remission and recurrence. Finally, the only option was aggressive and expensive rounds of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy. Yee questioned whether she could put Jack through anymore, let alone how she or Rogue could ever afford the treatments. “This dog literally saved my life and gave me everything,” she says, so they pooled what they could, borrowed, and crowdfunded the rest.
Amazingly, the aggressive treatment seemed to work. “I could see it in him almost immediately,” says Yee, her smile returning. “His energy was up. His appetite was up, everything like he was. He looked completely different after all these treatments.” Jack is still on chemotherapy, which he can now take orally, and goes in for regular testing, but he is technically in remission. As Jack became healthier, his personality returned; he got restless. “He’s driving me nuts,” says Yee. “You wouldn’t even think that this kid has cancer, because he just wants to go.”
“This dog literally saved my life and gave me everything.”
In spring 2023, shortly after his 11th birthday, Jack was back in his happy place—at work. Yee broke down in tears, overwhelmed with the joy of watching Jack back at it, sniffing for squirrels in the woods of Washington. “It was just such the right choice to put him back in the field,” says Yee.
“To see the two of them actually back in the field working, I honestly didn’t think it would have been possible,” says Smith, who recently lost one of his own dogs to the same cancer.
As much as Yee took care of Jack during his illness, he was helping her, too. “Having him back in my life and remembering how much love I had for him, really changed a lot,” says Yee. “In my mind for that year, I didn’t care about anything. I lost the person who essentially raised me and gave me everything that I have. I needed that reminder. In a really fucked up way, Jack’s cancer saved me.”
Jack, now 11, is enjoying a new lease on life as a conservation educator. Roxanne Hoorn
A New Chapter
With two new leases on life, Yee and Jack are focusing on slowing down from the years on the go. Yee’s career gave her a sense of purpose, but she can’t help but think of all she missed out on. “I was always on the road, months gone, never seeing my friends and family, not having a life outside of work,” she says. “All I did was work. But now, I can do it differently. This time around, I can put down roots in a city and do it how I want to.” That doesn’t mean Yee is done with Rogue. She’s still in the field occasionally—especially if Jack has a say in it—and the pair is also focusing on much-needed consulting and education for the rapidly expanding world of canine detection research, which is itself at a kind of crossroads.
“We are seeing such a huge increase in the popularity of this method, which on the one hand is wonderful—more dog teams helping wildlife, right?” says Hartman. “But with this rise comes the caveat that if we as a field are not developing it ethically or sustainably, we could see the collapse of something fragile.” People with pet dogs are starting to saturate the field, for example, and these enthusiasts offer up cheaper or free canine services, without formal, rigorous training. If they muddy the reputation of the research method, Hartman, Smith, and Yee, say, then there’s one less place for dogs like Jack.
Now Yee is crafting a new life in Oregon with Jack, her pet dog Riley, and occasionally Dio, her other Rogue partner. But she still has plans for adventure. Her next project is helping a canine team in Hawaiʻi learn to sniff out invasive snails. And the Rogue team is just glad to have her back. “We just don’t come across folks like Collette with her skills,” says Smith. “And not just with the dogs, but her skills at doing anything. Having her come back in any capacity is fantastic for us. Honestly, even if she wasn’t working with us, just to have her come for the holidays is very special. Just to be around her is fantastic.” Jack seems to feel the same way.",,Atlas Obscura,Pangolin,,,0.1,0.9,"Wildlife, Other",Other,Other,English

How Junior joined Twende animation series
Junior immediately expressed his interest when he heard that animation was looking for its lead actor because it was something he had always dreamed of doing.
""During the pandemic in 2020, my cousin Kwame told me that an animation about a pangolin was looking for its lead voice actor. Without thinking too much about it, I expressed an interest in auditioning for it,"" he said.
However, despite all his accolades, the young thespian had no voiceover experience, so he decided to consult his sister, Lupita, before his audition.
Junior says that the award-winning actress was happy for him, giving him tips and advice on tackling voiceovers, having done quite a number herself.
 ""I called my sister for some advice and tips on voiceover work. We geeked out about what a cool opportunity it would be, and so I went into the audition feeling very excited and ready to play and be receptive to all the directors thoughts,"" he elaborated.
Suffice it to say, Junior got the role and now voices the character alongside fellow thespian June Gachui, who voices the character Nuru.

Overview. New York-based studio Civilian has acted as an architectural design consultant and overseen the interior design for Newlab at Michigan Central, housed in The Book Depository building, an Art Deco landmark designed by the Detroit-based architect Albert Kahn in 1936.

Operated by Michigan Central and Newlab, Civilian has transformed the building into a state-of-the-art innovation hub to house hundreds of entrepreneurs and inventors focused on the development of new sustainable and equitable solutions to the most pressing challenges at the intersection of mobility and society. When it opens in spring 2023, Newlab at Michigan Central will become the first major piece of a larger civic and urban redevelopment plan and overall vision to create a new mobility innovation district around Detroits Michigan Central Train Station. A longstanding collaborator of Newlab, Civilian Nicko Elliott oversaw the interiors of Newlabs first New York space in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and at 77 Washington Street.

Inspiration. In approaching the ambitious adaptive reuse project, Civilian worked in dialogue with Kahns architecture and the corporate modernist design heritage of the region. The studio has developed a design language that pays homage to the buildings history while making legible the groundbreaking work done by the engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs that will occupy its collaborative workspaces. Civilian aimed to create an environment that highlights Kahns influence in the region as well as his foundational role in shaping the look of the modern world.

In the early twentieth century, Albert Kahn's Ford factory buildings were widely published internationally and were profoundly influential on the European avant-garde, who were taken by the rationally proportioned structure, lack of ornamentation, straightforward material expression, and oversized expanses of windows. At the time of The Book Depository's construction, Kahn's design influence was widely evident internationally, from exhibitions associated with the Bauhaus to the work of designers like Charlotte Perriand.

Design Scheme. Civilian has worked with architecture firm Gensler, who acted as Architect of Record and oversaw the meticulous core-and-shell renovation of the long-abandoned Book Depository building. The 270,000 sq ft, three-story structure, originally designed as a mail sorting station, later became book storage for Detroits public schools. Its delicately detailed brick façade, heavily patinated concrete interior, and rigid grid of martini cap columns have informed the spatial and material sensibility of the interiors. Throughout the project, Civilian strove to create unexpected programmatic adjacencies and visual connections between production spaces and work and amenity spaces to foster collaboration and connection.

Upon entering the facility one is greeted by a prefabricated rosewood and pressed stainless steel reception desk which is installed around a martini-glass column. The adjoining waiting area overlooks a 2,000 sq ft exhibition space, entered through a gate of three 12' stainless steel and ribbed glass doors, which will focus on the next generation of mobility innovation in Michigan. The planes making up the interior space are held off the existing architecture creating a literally porous space with a visual connection to adjacent program spaces and base building while telegraphing outward the work taking place within the Newlab community.

At the heart of the project lies a 200-seat event space overlooking a state-of-the-art 11,000 sq ft robotics and prototyping facility. By opening the four 20' x 15' lift doors - which were maximally scaled to fit between the columns - the event space transforms into a porous storytelling and education space through dynamic programming for the local community at large. Linking the prototyping facility and the exhibition space are two open studio spaces with desking, lounge spaces, meeting and conference rooms, and classrooms.

One floor up, Civilian created a year-round interior tree-fern park with lounge seating and worktables in the new double-height atrium space. The 2nd floor contains additional open studio and amenity spaces along with closed private studios. The third floor similarly contains a mix of private and open studio spaces along with a private lounge. The basement of the building is connected to the Michigan Central campus by a tunnel and provides dedicated garage studio spaces, along with open studios and lounges.

Furniture. Throughout the project, Civilian combined American design classics from Michigan-based furniture brand MillerKnoll with a carefully considered selection of refinished vintage furniture, and commissioned contemporary pieces.
© Brian W. Ferry
Complementing the architectural approach and furniture selection concept, Civilian designed a series of bespoke tables and storage cabinets, especially for the project. The robust solid ash and laminate pieces draw heavily from the work of 1930s furniture designers whose fascination with Fordist mass production and interest in the combination of machined finishes, laminates, and natural materials influenced the design vocabulary of the modern world since.

289,Francie Lin,Sylvia Plath’s botanical interests offer a fresh perspective on the poet’s life and work in a Smith College exhibit,'The Bell Jars'' immersive approach stirs up questions about intellectual opportunities for women at midcentury.,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/11/30/arts/sylvia-plaths-botanical-interests-offer-fresh-perspective-poets-life-work-smith-college-exhibit/,https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/xoh8K0eXtRqAST_MMZ_nl_Hr8OI=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/GWIRXCKT2HAMMPD5QS3QMQAJVY.JPG,2023-11-30T16:41:21Z,"But Bell Jars seeks to draw visitors into Plaths era and imagination through physical experience as well. In the Fern House, the sudden dense, perfumed scent given off by the fronds is paired with an essay on Doreen, the sensuous friend in Plaths novel whose smell reminds main character Esther of the musk of crushed sweet fern. In the Camellia Corridor, which also houses orchids, Plaths Fever 103 is posted along with a QR code link to a recording of Plath herself, her Boston-inflected voice conveying the poems tortured exhilaration: Hothouse baby in its crib/ The ghastly orchid/ Hanging its hanging garden in the air.
Fever 103 can be read in any number of ways, but its first line (Pure? What does it mean?) broadcasts at least some of the concerns that haunted Plath: sexuality, self-definition, the limitations of traditional femininity. Other parts of the exhibit take those concerns and steer them in a more literal direction. While Plath used the bell jar in her novel as a metaphor for the isolation of the unwell mind from the rest of society and though it is widely interpreted as a symbol of entrapment in prescribed feminine roles in this show, the bell jar becomes a riff in its own right.
A portion of the exhibit features the historical uses of the bell jar, among other scientific equipment employed by Smith biology professors before and during Plaths time at the college. (Plaths botany instructor used bell jars to measure the effects of transpiration on the absorption of radioactive phosphorous a reflection, the exhibit notes, of the eras fears about nuclear fallout, imagery of which also crops up in Plaths work.)
Besides being a formidable poet, Plath also had a talent for drawing, and reproductions of her sketches an intricate pen-and-ink drawing of horse chestnuts, an abstract willow tree with burls suggested by wavy, scalloped lines hang in the plant houses exhibition gallery. They arent framed but aretacked to a board above a small desk area complete with an Oriental runner rug and reading chairs set up for visitors to peruse collections of Plaths poetry, drawings, and biographies.
The casualness and personal detail (Plaths four-year transcript is also tacked to the board) invites viewers to contemplate what Plath might have seen and felt as a Smith student in the 50s a hands-on tactic that Bell Jars makes use of in other ways as well. Guests are invited to complete a botany class exercise from Plaths era in the Fern Room; clipboards and pencils are available for anyone wanting to explore the conservatory via the botanical drawing exercises the poet would have encountered as a student in Botany 11.
As for the more disturbing elements of Plaths history her suicide in 1963, for instance the exhibit touches upon those briefly. But in many ways the issues the show raises have to do not just with Plath herself but the broader plight of women and the limited opportunities available to them at midcentury. Botany, considered a feminine science in the 1700s, began to exclude women from its professional ranks as its stature grew; by 1943, the exhibit notes, Smith professors seeking to understand what skills would make their botany students more employable in the field were told by some institutions that they mostly hired men and that useful skills for women would be typing and stenography.
That fact recalls a passage of The Bell Jar, in which Esther says: For a while I toyed with the idea of being a botanist studying the wild grasses in Africa or the South American forests I loved cutting up leaves and putting them under the microscope and drawing the odd, heart-shaped leaf in the sex cycle of the fern, it seemed so real to me.
Esther isnt necessarily Plath herself, but that observation of reality is specific enough to hear the ring of personal truth in it. Plaths ambitions tended toward the literary, and her psychiatric struggles may have been independent of her career, but this exhibit, with its combination of womens history and biographical detail, stirs up some poignant questions about Plath, and by extension other women of her era. Had Plath followed her scientific inclinations, would her sense of self, anchored by the reality of rigorous inquiry and scientific observation, have been stable enough to offer her a different fate? The Bell Jars leaves room to reflect, imagine, and measure the distance between the present and the not-so-faraway past.

290,Anna Souter,Women’s Oppression Is the Earth’s Oppression,The work on gender and ecology in RE/SISTERS at the Barbican suggests that it is time to re-examine and re-engage with ecofeminism.,http://hyperallergic.com/859664/womens-oppression-is-the-earths-oppression-resisters-london-barbican-art-gallery/,https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/12/03.-Laura-Aguilar-Nature-Self-Portrait-5-1996-copy.jpg,2023-12-05T23:02:43Z,"LONDON The tradition of landscape photography is entwined with a patriarchal settler-colonial perspective. As a large-bodied, queer Chicana woman, Laura Aguilar subverts this context through her Nature Self-Portrait series (1996). The small black and white images present her nude form positioned among boulders and trees, revealing parallels between the landscape and the body that does not conform to conventional standards. 
These works are emblematic of RE/SISTERS: A Lens on Gender and Ecology at Londons Barbican Art Gallery. The exhibition draws out the systemic links between the oppression of women and the anthropogenic destruction of the planet, indicating how the exploitative extraction of the earth suggests a widespread patriarchal, colonial, and capitalist mindset. In particular, RE/SISTERS seeks to platform work by artists from the Global Majority and Indigenous peoples, pointing to pervasive environmental racism and how care for the planet has been divided along both gendered and racialized lines which are also frontlines of the resistance.
Aguilars self-portraits highlight how bodies, landscapes, and bodies within landscapes are coded with racialized, gendered, and socioeconomic associations. At the same time, in presenting both body and landscape as spaces of equal and interwoven beauty, the artist mobilizes her multivalent identity, asserting her right to access natural spaces and to express a relationship with a territory from which she is systematically excluded.

In Nature Self-Portrait #5 (1996), Aguilar faces away from the camera, looking out across a large open field. Standing among a calligraphic composition of dead tree branches, she reaches her hands to the sky, stretching her fingers out like twigs. The contours and dimples of her body echo the gnarled, dry trunk, while the branches cast deep shadows over her skin, the fall of light and texture suggesting an intimate correlation between person and plant. There is a compelling (and carefully crafted) casualness to the work; the slanting horizon line recalls a snapshot, while also cleverly forming a perpendicular cross with Aguilars tilted body. Although the artist was struggling with depression when she took this photograph, the image appears defiantly joyful, expansive, and carefree. 
These quietly confident images suggest a profound connection between body and earth. This is conceptual ground long eschewed by many feminist thinkers since the post-1970s decline of the ecofeminist movement, perhaps from fear of reinforcing patriarchal associations between women and so-called nature. However, the work on gender and ecology in RE/SISTERS suggests that it is time to re-examine and re-engage with ecofeminism.
Aguilar, like many other artists in the exhibition, rejects a simplistic binary feminization of nature, instead adopting a nuanced notion of the earth as a matrix of fertility, unruliness, and oppression. Throughout, the show emphasizes how the alignment of women and Indigenous communities with nature has been exploited by capitalist-colonial forces. However, there is also a sense of how this alignment has produced a radical politics of care, resistance, and protest. For instance, the exhibition juxtaposes images of anti-nuclear protest at the Greenham Common Womens Peace Camp in the 1980s with Pamela Singhs contemporaneous photographs of women resisting the felling of trees in India during the Chipko movement.

As the introductory wall text states, RE/SISTERS explores the connections between gender and environmental justice as indivisible parts of a global struggle to address the power structures that threaten our ecosphere. The exhibition is particularly effective where it uses themes of fluidity and queerness to consider alternatives to the rigid hierarchies of patriarchal systems. For instance, in a series of powerful photo performances, queer Indigenous artist Uýra uses experimental drag to form human-animal hybrids in an interrogation of interspecies relationships. 
Another key example is Anne Duk Hee Jordans film installation Ziggy and the Starfish (2022), which sets the sexual activities of hermaphroditic marine animals to a soundtrack from vintage erotic films. The playful film highlights both the familiarity and the wonderful strangeness of this underwater world, crafting parallels between gender fluidity and the subversively porous boundaries of interspecies kinship. 
RE/SISTERS demands an unusual degree of engagement from the viewer. This is a text-heavy exhibition presenting a series of challenging ideas that may be unfamiliar to many, such as the labor of ecological care and intersectional theories around environmental racism. However, the exhibition rewards close attention with a rich and complicated narrative, one that ultimately places woman and other marginalized communities at the center of both the climate crisis and the social justice movement, as those most oppressed and more hopefully as key members of the resistance.

Taking up the most space was Mustins weed wrench, an L-shaped specialty tool branded The Extractigator, which leverages the ground to yank deeply rooted vegetation from the earth.
We were in the parking lot of Island Center Forest, a 440-acre wooded park home to miles of hiking trails and one large pond where birdwatchers flock. Island Center Forest is on Vashon Island, southwest of Seattle. Mustins summer home is on Vashon, and my partner and I have a small farm here.
We were looking for English holly, a cherished Christmas symbol that is threatening biodiversity in the Pacific Northwest. We were there to poison it.
Perhaps nobody in the state of Washington has killed more holly trees than Mustin. After a long career as a doctor, Mustin retired in 2013 and began dedicating several days a week to bushwacking deep into the woods to destroy the plant he loathes.
We hiked through a tunnel of greenery: Douglas firs towered above and sword ferns fanned around our feet. It was a mild day in July, and Mustin, wearing long sleeves and work pants, worked up a sweat. At 75, he is a discursive thinker and talker, answering questions before I could ask them.
Start looking for where the contrast in the vegetation stands out, he said. Hollys dark green leaves and red berries pop against the forests lighter hues. We climbed over downed branches, dodged stinging nettles and stomped across carpets of trailing native blackberry. 
We walked until we found a tree not already flagged for removal by county workers. Standing at about 20 feet tall, its many branches were lined with alternating leaves, each shaped like a POW! bubble in a comic strip, oval with serrated edges. The reds and greens were unmistakably Christmassy. The trunk split into a v-shape, the thicker sub-trunk reaching toward a nearby alder as if it wanted a hug.

Mustin knelt and dug into his backpack, pulling out a plastic tube containing .22-caliber shells hed purchased online from a forestry supply store in Colorado. Mustins shells contained a heavy concentration of tarry black imazapyr, an herbicide favored by weed technicians as the bestreally, the onlymethod for tackling big holly efficiently.
Most people who inject holly with herbicide-filled shells use a specialized spring-loaded lance called an EZ-Ject. To avoid alarming anyone, Mustin left his EZ-Ject in the trunk with the weed wrench. Its kind of like walking into the park with a pickax or a shovel, he said. Instead, wed have to Macgyver todays application.
Some might accuse Mustin of committing a misdemeanorherbiciding without a license. Mustin would argue that he still operates as an arm of the Washington Department of Natural Resources, which supervised his holly-killing sprees from 2015 to 2022, when he led volunteers on restoration excursions. Today he mostly works independently, finding solo missions more efficient, though the state still occasionally supplies him with herbicide equipment and he maintains permission to work on state land.
Using pliers, he carefully lifted an imazapyr-filled shell and pressed its open end against the holly. With a tack hammer in his other hand, he tap-tap-tapped the shell into the wood, repeating this process every four inches around the tree. He stopped halfway; I finished the other half, completing a collar of shells around the trunk.
Over the next few weeks, the tree would absorb the imazapyr, which would travel through its vascular system, slowly killing it. By the fall, there may not be many leaves left on there at all, Mustin assured me.
We made plans to return.
VASHON ISLAND, at less than 40 square miles, accounts for a tiny percentage of the hollies invading the Pacific Northwest. English holly has roots in parks and forests from Vancouver Island to the Willamette Valley. Municipal watersheds, private timberlands and tribal nations have all contended with it, and its become widely established in the lowlands of Olympic National Park.
There are more than 500 species of holly, but only the English variety (Ilex aquifolium) threatens Northwestern ecosystems. In its native rangeEurope, West Asia and Northern AfricaEnglish holly can grow upward of 80 feet tall, but the tallest known specimens in the United States hover around 50 feet. Conservationists are less worried about hollys height, however, than they are about its spread.
Under human control, holly can be shaped and shifted to meet our needs for beauty and privacy. Cut through a holly stem, and several new limbs will eventually emerge. Wander through a Northwest neighborhood, and you might see holly hedges meticulously shaped into sharp-edged boxes.
Some of the same qualities that make holly such a desirable landscaping plant also make it a ruthless invader. It can live for a century, withstand considerable damage and thrive in the shade. It also reproduces prolifically; many parts of one tree can make new hollies.
Hollys shallow root system spawns new growths through a process called suckering, in which holly fledglings, connected to their parents network, shoot out of the ground. Dozens of holly suckers can emerge from a single root system. Over time, some suckers develop their own root systems and strike out on their own, emerging as independent plants.
Holly branches can also produce new hollies. Lower branches on taller trees often sag groundward, brushing the soil. Given enough moisture, roots can grow from just about any point of contact, supporting a new holly stem in a process called layering. If something in the woodsa falling branch or an animalsevers the connecting shoot, youve got a new holly tree.

Suckering and layering often produce dense thickets, which suppress native plants, reduce visibility for wildlife, and haunt conservationists. But roots and branches can spread holly only so far.
Long-distance travel requires the collaboration of bird and berry. The red of ripe holly berries, somewhere between Kool-Aid and blood, beckons birds like a well-lit diner at night. The cold-hardy berries must look especially tasty in wintertime, when other foods are scarce.
When robins find holly berries, they split into teams. One team dive-bombs the berry bonanza, picking fruit at a speedy clip. The others watch for predators from nearby trees. Fruit in tow, a feeding robin retreats to a relay perch for lookout duty, allowing its flockmates to take their turn at the buffet. The robin digests its meal while keeping guard. Processing berry pulp, from beak to butt, takes about 15 minutes, though, contrary to popular belief, most holly seeds do not depart through droppings. Instead, they go down and up again, exiting via mouth, one-by-one, like Pez.
During a feeding frenzy, robins can regurgitate holly seeds more than 150 feet from the source. If a predator say, a hawkinterrupts the meal, the birds may scatter nearly a third of a mile before expelling their seeds.
Viable seeds can take years to sprout, but once they do, the resulting sapling has the potential to grow into a mature tree capable of suckering and layering. If the tree happens to be a female near a male, it will one day produce berries.
ITS ONE OF THOSE THINGS that, once you see it, you start seeing it everywhere, said David Stokes, a former ecologist at the University of Washington Bothell and perhaps the foremost expert on invasive holly in the Northwest.
Stokes, a fit 70-year-old, has kind eyes and a professorial beard. As a doctoral student at the University of Washington, he studied the migration patterns of Magellanic penguins in Patagonia. Later, his focus shifted to urban ecology. As a professor at Sonoma State University, he dabbled in invasive plants as faculty advisor for a student conservation group, leading field trips to a creek where they removed the notorious tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima).
After returning to the Seattle area in 2006 to teach at the UW Bothell, north of his alma mater, Stokes spent a lot of time at St. Edward State Park. Walking in the shade of alders and maples, Stokes noticed clusters of English holly in the understory, something he knew did not belong. Alarmingly, the non-native shrub appeared to be thriving in a mature forest, contrary to the prevailing scientific view.
When the study of invasive plants took off in the 80s and 90s, scientists focused on the fast-growing, sun-loving species that overrun grasslands, farms and disturbed or logged forests. Ecologists thought intact forests were largely immune to such invasions.
Scientists began publicly questioning this assumption in the mid-aughts. In a frequently cited 2009 paper in the journal Frontiers in Ecology, a trio of researchers identified more than 139 shade-tolerant plants that have invaded deeply shaded forests. The authors theorized that the relatively slow growth of these plants lulled scientists into ignoring their potentially severe and long-term impacts on forest ecosystems worldwide.
By the time Stokes noticed holly on his walks, some researchers and environmentalists had already raised anecdotal concerns about the plant. In 1992, Robert Ticknor, an Oregon horticulturalist, expressed misgivings about holly trees where they are not desired. Ticknor had devoted his life to ornamental plants, including holly, often in service of growers supplying the Christmas market; hed even lived on Holly Street once, with a daughter named Holly. But toward the end of his career, Ticknor questioned whether English holly was, as his article in the Holly Society of America Journal put it, A Jewel or a Menace in the Pacific Northwest?
Once you see it, you start seeing it everywhere.
Then, in 2005, a US Forest Service researcher named Andrew Gray published perhaps the earliest data-backed report on hollys presence in Northwestern woods. As part of the Forest Inventory and Analysis, a program that sends crews out across the country to collect data, Gray studied invasive plants in Oregon forests. He singled out English hollyand another European import, English ivyfor their shade tolerance and predicted that they would continue to spread in the states lowland woods.
In 2011, Stokes decided to determine the true rate of hollys spread. He chose St. Edward State Park as the site of his field research.
Student lab assistants traversed a 20-acre section of the 300-acre park, treading in straight lines regardless of topography, up and down steep inclines, over and under downed branches. If a tree blocked their path, theyd step around it, then return to position.
Whenever one was spotted, the students took a sample. Sometimes that meant pulling up a young sapling and sticking it in a plastic bag. Sometimes, Stokes said, an unlucky person landed the triceps-burning job of sawing through a dense trunk.
The field work took two field seasons. Wood rounds gathered, Stokes and his assistants counted their tree rings to discern their age. The resulting data covered almost half a century.
The first holly to invade Stokes study area sprouted in 1966, during a residential construction boom north of the park, where ornamental holly still grows today. The invasion started slowly, and then exploded, a common pattern for invasive species. After 1990, the holly population in their study area doubled about every six years.
Stokes and his students also observed a significant reduction of native vegetation under holly canopies. In the biggest holly clump they found, roughly 645 square feet, they found no native plants. Stokes findings were published in the journal Northwest Science in 2014.

But the forests of St. Edward werent the only woods where holly spread exponentially. In August, 18 years after Gray published his analysis of invasive species, I asked him over Zoom if he had since tested his prediction that holly would spread in the Northwests shaded woods. He hadnt, but was willing to take a look.
With input from Stokes, Gray crunched two decades of Forest Service data on holly in Washington and Oregon. The surveys were taken from 2001 to 2009 and 2010 to 2019.
When Gray looked at all 87 of the forest plots that had holly in either decade, he found a 108 percent increase of holly cover in Oregon and 105 percent in Washington. Over 10 years, the holly spread had roughly doubled.
When he looked at plots with at least 50 percent tree covershadethe increase was starker: 143 percent increase in Oregon and 119 percent in Washington.
Grays analysis of this publicly accessible data has not gone through a formal peer-review process, but I sent it to Stokes for his opinion. Stokes noted the differences in their methodology, but said that Grays findings broadly confirmed his own conclusion that holly spreads exponentially in closed canopy forests. Grays data provides further evidence that hollys rate of spread is very rapid relative to ecological time scales, Stokes wrote to me in an email. The relatively slow growth of holly in the forest compared to that of the weeds more often seen near places used by humans has kept it from getting as much attention as, say, Scotch broom or tansy ragwort.
Invasion will take place more slowly on human scales, Stokes said. Its when you consider that a forest takes 200, 300, 500 years to matureits happening quickly.
IN THE MID-TO-LATE 1800s, European settlers planted the first hollies in the Pacific Northwest, perhaps as a reminder of home. A Dutchman named Jan Bajema, for example, sailed to New York City in 1893. He changed his name to John, settled on a farm in north Washington, fathered 15 children, and, according to one grandchild, planted several holly trees.
In the 20th century, US demand for Christmas wreaths skyrocketed. A few entrepreneurial farmers in the Northwest wagered that English holly could make them wealthy. The region benefited from an exclusive monopoly, as one grower put it. English holly, as its name implies, thrives in a temperate, wet climate. The lowlands of western Washington and Oregon are its Goldilocks zone.
By the 1940s, Washington and Oregon were supplying the vast majority of holly shipped in the US Farmers saw it as a safe investment, and nurseries marketed holly as a retirement plan. Plant a holly orchard and let nature do the work for you, read one brochure. By the end of the decade, an estimated 300 acres of western Washington were dedicated to holly.
Its unclear whether this marketing inspired either John Bajemas third son, Dingeman, who started a holly farm along the Columbia Gorge after a career as a schoolteacher, or Dingemans son Ken, who spent many weekends and evenings as a teenager helping his father harvest holly branches during the cold, wet winters. The worst weather of the Pacific Northwest, he told me over the phone. 
Invasion will take place more slowly on human scales. Its when you consider that a forest takes 200, 300, 500 years to matureits happening quickly.
After a long career in the federal government, Ken Bajema retired in 1988, returned to his childhood home, and picked up where his dad left off: Harvesting, cutting and shipping holly branches to customers across the US. There were about 50 growers in Washington and Oregon then, and the industry brought in millions of dollars annually.
The same year Bajema started farming, he also volunteered to serve on the Skamania County Noxious Weed Board, which regulates unwanted plants in his county. In 2005, Bajema also joined the Washington State Noxious Weed Board, the governing body that decides which unwanted plants counties can regulate.
Bajema kept his private and public business separate for many years. But then his two worlds collided.
In January 2011, fresh off harvest season, Bajema traveled north to Olympia, walked past the grand columns of Washingtons neoclassical Capitol, and took a seat before the state House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee.

The fall before the hearing, officials in King County (which includes Seattle) sent a proposal to the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board asking Bajema and his colleagues to add English holly to its official list of regulated weeds.
Holly, a longtime tradition at Christmas, has taken a bum rap from activist groups for several years in news articles, publications, word of mouth and hearsay, Bajema told the lawmakers, apparently referring to conservationists warnings about hollys invasiveness. 
So, Bajema, holly farmer and holly regulator, donned yet another hat: holly lobbyist. As secretary of the Northwest Holly Growers Association, he launched an aggressive defense of his crop. Holly farmers dismissed claims of its invasiveness while extolling its value to the economy. Although the boards proposal would not have banned commercial production, farmers said that merely associating holly with weed could hurt sales.
Their campaign succeeded: The nine board members voted unanimously to keep English holly off their big list of bad weeds, citing the need for more empirical evidence.
A WEED IS JUST A PLANT out of place, or so the saying goes. From the late Middle Ages until very recently, out of place meant anywhere that might inconvenience agriculture: The noisome weeds, which without profit suck; The soils fertility from wholesome flowers, as the Gardener said in Shakespeares Richard II.
In 19th century America, industrialization brought new weeds to new places. Seeds crossed state lines as stowaways on trains or carriages. Farmers discovered new thorns, literally, in their sides and in their fields. And states began passing seed laws to target unwanted plants.
This approach to weeds, centering humans and ignoring the environment, was still mainstream when President Gerald Ford signed the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974, creating a Federal Noxious Weed List that regulates interstate and international commerce. Today, more than 100 species of plants are federally regulated; another 600 or so are controlled by state authorities.
Washingtons Noxious Weed Control Board resembles most of its cohorts in that it sprang from agricultural interests. When the Legislature created the board in 1969, lawmakers defined noxious weed as any plant that harms crops, livestock, or other property. 
This is a worst-case scenario. But it could get even worse.
It wasnt until the 1990s that agencies caught up with increasing scientific interest in ecological invasions. The state noxious weed board became the de facto invasive plant regulator. Now, out of place included forests, wetlands and wild prairies, as well as farms and ranches. Washington codified this change in 1997, when lawmakers expanded the legal definition of noxious weed to consider impacts on natural resources.
Trying to advance ecological goals through regulations that favored agricultural systems proved ineffective. Weed laws developed as a reaction to potential economic development, Bryan Endres, a professor of agricultural law at the University of Illinois, told me. In 2013, Endres helped author a paper in the journal Bioscience showing that weed regulators heavily favor listing agricultural pests over ecological ones.
Such was the situation in 2011, when Bajema lobbied lawmakers to prevent holly from ever again appearing before the noxious weed board. It wasnt enough that the industry had already kept holly off the noxious list; Bajema was hurt that the state board had even considered the question. The damage to our industry has already begun, Bajema told the House Agriculture Committee. Once an allegation is made, your crop is guilty.

Working with the Washington State Farm Bureau, the holly lobby pushed a bill that would have banned any commercially grown crop from being listed as a weed. That was a nonstarter for state weed officials. A compromise bill, eventually signed into law, said that new scientific research on a plants invasiveness would have to be published before it could be brought to a second noxious weed vote. 
The slow pace of science guaranteed that the growers had bought themselves time. Stokes study would not be published for another three years. But it would take much longer for the Noxious Weed Control Board to consider listing holly again.
IF YOU ASK HOLLY WATCHERS why theyre so worried, theyll often point to an overrun section of forest a total hollypocalypsein a fenced-off area in the suburbs south of Seattle.
On a damp morning this August, I met Zoe Loutos, a restoration ecologist for Seattle Public Utilities, in a parking lot outside the fence. We were joined by Jamie Trotto, an invasive species technician, professor David Stokes and Elliott Church, his former research assistant.
Beyond the fence and restricted-access signs lay Lake Youngs, a reservoir that provides treated drinking water to the Seattle metro area. The lake is surrounded by 2,000 acres of forest. Access to the woods is restricted to Lake Youngs staff. We planned to visit a section on McElhoe Peninsula, which is named for 19th century homesteaders, though Loutos calls it Holly Peninsula.
Its a legend, Church said. Neither he nor Stokes had been there. You see the pictures and go, Wow. 
Church, whod been Stokes lab assistant over 10 years ago, continued to research English holly, completing a masters thesis on the plant in managed timber forests in 2016. Now 32, he works as an arborist. On the day we met, Church wore his hair in a bun, binoculars around his neck and a wool Forest Service jacket from eBay.
Youll have to tell me if its worse than St. Edwards, Loutos said, wearing a neon orange safety vest and a gray baseball cap embroidered with a hummingbird. Loutos led a three-car caravan through a gate and onto a dike road encircling a lake larger than Disneyland. 
Before we entered the forest, Loutos reminded us that Lake Youngs was closed to the public. Nobody seemed to know for sure exactly how long it had been closed, though Loutos thought it had been since the 1920s, when a dam was built to increase the lakes capacity; that would suggest that birds introduced holly to the area rather than humans. In any case, the limited access makes it a poster child for a holly infestation unmitigated by human intervention.
Anyway, Loutos said. Should we walk into the woods?
She led us up a short incline. Our boots squeaked against wet salal, while damp shrubs brushed our pants, soaking them. And then we emerged into what Loutos aptly called a sea of holly.
We saw holly to our left and holly to our right: 20-foot-tall trees dappled in beams of sunlight. Ankle-biter hollies congregated below us, and tangles of branches blocked the light; at times it was nearly opaque, nothing but bare ground underneath. Partially felled holly trees grew at angles, like javelins thrown by gods. Impenetrable thickets obscured our view. We saw sick hollies with yellowish-brown splotches on their leaves, but very few dead ones.
This is a worst-case scenario, Stokes observed, carrying a meter stick that doubled as a hiking pole. But it could get even worse. 
You got these guys filling in between, Church added, pointing to a cluster of young saplings. The retired professor and his former student bounced ideas off each other as if they were back in the classroom.
In this case, you wouldnt have a complete replacement of vegetation because its Douglas firs above the holly, Stokes said. Hollys never gonna get that tall. But the whole understory, instead of being native plants, youll have holly.
Holly would be in a position to really dominate, Church agreed. If a forest disturbance, like a storm or fire, wiped out a chunk of the overstory, it could change that successional trajectory. Translation: It could become a holly forest.
The other thing that we never really addressed is the potential for holly to be a ladder fuel, Stokes added. In a 2022 wildfire risk study, King County cited holly as a flammable thicket-forming understory shrub that could carry flames upward.
In recent years, wildfires in the Pacific Northwest have become more frequent and intense, a trend that will likely continue with climate change. 
The scientists tossed out hypotheses and imagined experiments. Could they replicate their St. Edward study here, on Holly Peninsula? Maybe compare the age of the hollies with Douglas firs to determine which came first? What changes would they notice in holly if they moved from the outer edge of the forest inward? 
Church was most excited about the sickly holly. He walked quickly, as if spellbound, to a plant with graying shoots and yellowing leaves. Palming a cluster of leaves in one hand, he snapped a photo with his phone. Itd be great to get some cuttings to a lab and get some analysis, he said. (Seattle Public Utilities would first need to sign off on any kind of scientific collection, so no collecting was done that day.)
A few meters away, Stokes was examining a plant with crinkly brown leaves and a desiccating stem.
Is that a holly thats totally dead there? Church shouted to Stokes. We descended on the tree. Stokes voice lifted multiple octaves. Check this out, he trilled. He pointed at a fresh sprout, shooting out from the hollys lifeless stem.
Its suckering from a dead Loutos said.
Stokes finished her sentence: from a dead tree!
IN THE SPRING OF 2022, private citizens emailed the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board, urging it to label holly as a noxious weed. That set the stage for another vote.
Eleven years had passed since Ken Bajema successfully campaigned to stop King County from listing holly. Conservationists had reason to be more hopeful this time; Stokes research lent scientific legitimacy to all the anecdotal evidence of a holly invasion.
At Bajemas suggestion, weed board staffers worked with the state attorney general to add the term feral hollymeaning not intentionally planted by humansto Washingtons administrative code. The proposed listing would cover only feral holly and explicitly exclude holly grown on farms or for ornamental purposes.
Bajema had returned to the board in 2018 after several years away, reprising his role as hollys defender.
He didnt think much of the new research. Dr. Stokes has a hatred for holly, Bajema told me. Hes been after holly for 20 years.

During one September meeting held on WebEx, Bajema tried to shut down the holly-listing effort by invoking the law he helped pass in 2011. He claimed, inaccurately, that there is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence to prove that holly is a noxious weed. A staffer corrected him, noting that at least two such articles had been published since the last vote.
I dont recall the Holly Society of America or the Horticultural Society signing off on those peer reviews, Bajema replied. (Industry groups do not take part in the multi-step, anonymous peer-review process for scientific journals).
Stokes, Church and Andrea Watts, another researcher who wrote a masters thesis on holly, presented their findings to the board. Stokes left one meeting thinking, Well, this is a slam dunk.
The vote fell on Nov. 2, 2022. Though two members were absent, there was a quorum, and the director called the roll:
Ken Bajema, holly grower: Nay.
Jerry Hendrickson, former rancher: Nay.
Allen Evenson, weed inspector: Yea.
Carey Caruso, beekeeper: Nay.
Janet Spingath, habitat restoration specialist: Yea.
Bill Agosta, retired chemist: Yea.
A tie means no. English holly remained unlisted in Washington. 
Bajemas victory seemed completefor about a year. In response to several complaints over his clear conflict of interest, the board passed a new rule barring any of its members from voting on proposed weeds in which they have a financial interest. This time, only Bajema voted Nay. 
THIS OCTOBER, Henry Mustin and I returned to Island Center Forest to check on our poisoned holly tree. Mustin, whod spent the morning clearing holly in another park, wore raingear. I lacked his foresight and was once again doomed to soaking-wet jeans.
Fall was in full swing. Fern tips were turning brown and crinkly. Baseball-sized mushrooms poked out of the ground along the trail. My eyes, now trained, locked on all the hollies, evergreen standouts in the senescing understory. 
After less than half an hour and a couple GPS consults, Mustin spotted our tree. It was a skeleton of its former self, its top completely devoid of leaves and its body thinned out, emaciated. Brown leaves sagged from the tips of branches, and most of the berries had dried up like prunes, black and wrinkled.
Its been a very effective injection, Mustin said.
Then I saw the saplings surrounding our tree, all very much alive. To truly eradicate this colony, wed have to return to Mustins trunk, grab more tools, and get our hands dirty again.
I thought of all the berry-bearing hollies still in this park. Poisoning our tree was relatively pain-free, but controlling thicker growths requires trimming, digging, wrenching, crawling, lifting and pulling. Its back-breaking, blood-drawing labor, often performed on hands and knees by underpaid 20-somethings just starting out in natural resource management. Or by the Henry Mustins of the world, volunteer weed warriors, the term used by stewardship groups who have found their calling in preserving natural habitats.
No one has calculated how much public money has been spent controlling holly in the Northwest. Washington State Parks spent more than $30,000 removing holly at St. Edward State Park after David Stokes studied that invasion. When Sally Nickelson, the former invasive species manager for Seattle Public Utilities, discovered the holly at Lake Youngs, the agency approved around $90,000 of taxpayer dollars for control work. Those effortsand many more tucked within local budgets and contractsmerely snip at an exponentially branching problem.
Even when holly hunters do defeat an invasion, keeping new hollies out requires constant vigilance and optimism.
During our field trip to Lake Youngs, Zoe Loutos described the hamster-on-a-wheel nature of her job. Thats a familiar feeling for me and honestly keeps me motivated, she told me. When Loutos tackles holly in the Cedar River Watershed, another natural area under her watch, she envisions Holly Peninsula as the disaster shes working to prevent. Im one piece of the puzzle. And even my little contribution is still meaningful.
Mustin represents another piece of the puzzle. He is credited with removing hundreds of hollies on Little Si, a small mountain and popular hiking spot east of Seattle. (On a recent hike there, I didnt see a single holly.) During our walks in Island Center Forest, Mustin often mused that a similar effort could work here. Its not an impossible task for even a few people to just stop it, he said.
Weeks later, I returned to our poisoned tree with gardening gloves and a weed wrench and yanked out the surrounding holly saplings. Following restoration best practices, I hung the freshly unearthed invaders on a nearby tree, keeping their roots away from the damp soil, ensuring they would stay dead.

In 1830 Charles Lyell—earth scientist, Scot—gazed into the far future and posited as much in his Principles of Geology, arguing that since the planet’s climate was cyclical (or so he believed), vanished creatures could yet be revived, along with their habitats, when the right conditions came back around: “The huge iguanodon might reappear in the woods, and the ichthyosaur in the sea, while the pterodactyl might flit again through umbrageous groves of tree-ferns.” As to whether people would get to witness the spectacle of this resurrected bestiary—well, if Lyell was never drawn to that question, it was because the answer was not up for debate. His was an age in which the prospect of Earth bereft of human occupancy was too abominable, too sacrilegious, to contemplate.
Near to two centuries on, the feeling of living through end-times is not alien to us. Indeed, in a world of waning wilderness and tyrannized wildlife, we have cause to view ourselves as the monsters of the moment. The planet’s climate is well established to oscillate between two steady states: the icehouse (when, at a minimum, both poles whiten) and the steamier greenhouse phase, glacier-free. But both the interval and intensity of the flux have been recast by industrial activity: NASA confirmed July 2023 as the hottest month ever recorded by global instrumentation; the journal Nature has published projections showing that carbon dioxide emissions will delay the next glacial inception by around fifty thousand years.
In the summer of 2022 a heat wave in London dried out the lakes in Crystal Palace Park. Visitors who had traveled to see the famous model dinosaurs there—Iguanodon sculptures, a Hylaeosaurus, a Megalosaurus, all erected in the Victorian era—were implored not to walk over the mud to touch them where they stood, on high ground no longer encircled by water, their fragile foundations open to the air. That same month The New York Times reported that a drought in Texas had exposed dinosaur tracks from around 113 million years ago in the newly dry channel of the Paluxy River. The three-toed prints were thought to be evidence of an Acrocanthosaurus, a bipedal carnivore that could weigh seven tons in maturity. Reading about the prints, I imagined the sunstruck river evaporating into pools, then puddles, until the last of it was held silverly in the footfalls of that ancient animal. For an hour or two, maybe, a person might have been able to see their own face reflected there, until that too was vaporized.
Dinosaurs are coming back, as it turns out; not alive, but surfacing into the ecological concerns of our moment. To think more deeply about what it might mean to learn about dinosaurs in this time of environmental crisis, I sat down with my eight-year-old nephew, Alex, to watch the latest season of Prehistoric Planet, a series narrated by David Attenborough and produced by the BBC Studios Natural History Unit.
The conceit of the show is that it is a nature documentary featuring extinct creatures, filmed (perhaps a better word is “created”) as though it were possible to spy on their mating rituals and hunting stratagems, social interactions, homemaking, and—in the case of young—acquisition of skills such as foraging and flight. This is achieved by layering together actual footage of some of the most extreme, remote landscapes on modern-day Earth with digital renderings of prehistoric animals and a host of other organisms from the Maastrichtian age, at the end of the Late Cretaceous epoch. Behind-the-scenes footage available online shows crew members blocking action sequences using dinosaur silhouettes and puppets—templates for the sophisticated visual effects added in postproduction by Moving Picture Company, the animators best known for their work on the 2019 remake of Disney’s The Lion King and the 2016 live-action adaptation of The Jungle Book.
The final product is persuasive: it really does appear as if a portal has been opened to a time before human memory, and extinct animals are back up on their feet. Across five half-hour episodes, dinosaurs, prehistoric reptiles, amphibians, mollusks, and a handful of protomammals lumber, dart, and drift through ordinary trials of survival. On the advice of experts, the animators reportedly spent months adjusting the subcutaneous structure of one dinosaur’s face alone: refining how soft tissues and nasal cavities, fat deposits and lip curl would inform shape, shadow, and motion.
Each episode opens with Attenborough standing in what looks to be a museum library, surrounded by shelves of leather-bound volumes and several skulls mounted on plinths—the nearest is clearly a Triceratops, with its colossal crest, beaked mouth, and distinctive trio of horns. Not one computer appears in the room. Though the tools of paleontology today extend to particle accelerators, algorithmic data modeling, and molecular biochemistry, when asked to picture the work of a paleontologist, who does not still conjure up images of dig sites under canvas tents? Whoisn’t put in mind of Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant in the 1993 film Jurassic Park?
“Journey to a time when nature put on its greatest show,” Attenborough announces with a flourish as his in-person introduction transitions to august voice-over. Now we’re in a murky forest, a volcanic caldera, a tidal pool. From here on, there are no cutaways to fossils, laboratories, or the talking heads of experts. Matters of accuracy—the limit of confidence underlying each scenario—are parked. We are instead immersed in the land- and seascapes of the atavistic past.
Only a few minutes in, Alex wanted to check that there really wasn’t anywhere we could go to see these animals. Like, actual dinosaur hideouts where this had been filmed? Backlit by a tropical sunset, a male Hatzegopteryx—a flying reptile with the stretch of a hang glider—exposes the forking veins in the membrane of his wing. A herd of brawny Isisaurus with quills wavering down their backs traverse a lava field, their outlines rippled by the heat. When a juvenile Austroraptor swallows a garfish, the down on the underside of its throat quivers. Animals familiar to us from the present day—lizards, dragonflies, crayfish—occasionally cross paths with simulated ones. A ray (actual footage) and a Mosasaurus (superimposed) share the screen, and the aquatic light playing across both makes it momentarily plausible that they might continue to coexist in some far-off quarter of the sea.
Prehistoric Planet showcases several dinosaur species that are feathered, fast-moving, and startlingly colorful. A family of Pectinodon chase swarming flies, their plumage ruffled by the effort. Bright blue Corythoraptor guard nests of lime-green eggs. A part of the series’s mission is to overwrite outmoded notions of extinct animals either as insatiable malignities driven to pitiless violence or as sluggish, maladapted automatons ill-fit for Earth. “Dragons of the prime/that tare each other in their slime,” Alfred Tennyson wrote of dinosaurs in 1850, in a poem we best remember today for the expression “nature, red in tooth and claw.”
Scientific consensus now holds that the dinosaurs perished because of perturbations in the climate triggered by volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps of western India and, more fatally, an asteroid that struck the Gulf of Mexico 66 million years ago. But back when their extinction was presumed to denote merely giving way to “higher order” animals, their rank as nature’s faulty prototypes was sustained by an image of prehistory populated by floundering, lumpen creatures. Sauropods were once described as being so hefty they’d have had to stand around in lagoons all day long to take the weight off their cloddish feet. Early illustrations of Tyrannosaurus showed it dragging its fat tail uselessly along the ground. Such depictions made sense if humankind were regarded not just as another iteration of evolution but as the apotheosis of a natural sorting process—the supreme being.
A corrective has been underway since the 1960s, colloquially known as the Dinosaur Renaissance. Scientific revisions of dinosaur locomotion and sensory acuity led to khaki brutes being replaced by sleeker, endothermic raptors, and species ornamented not only with iridescence but crests, spines, spots, and stripes. Dinosaur lineages were ancestrally connected to birds—grist for conjecture on behaviors such as territoriality, flocking, and colony living. Researchers theorized that some non-avian archosaurs—a category of bygone reptile—might have been capable of seeing ultraviolet colors imperceptible to us, a faculty that could have led these animals to exhibit intricate patterns signaling rivalry or factoring into mate choice. Extinct Ice Age animals were likewise reappraised. Discoveries about the hearing of the giant ground sloth Megatherium suggested that it might have been responsive to infrasound, as modern-day elephants are.
The late 1990s heralded the rise of the sensitive dinosaur. Apex predators with a bite pressure in excess of any living carnivore were transformed from nature’s most chilling, indiscriminate killers into pair-bonded, doting parents. Prehistoric migration, courtship, resting states like hibernation and sleep, and the soundscapes of the distant past gathered more attention in published research. Toward the end of the 2010s American scientists announced that T. rex likely enjoyed nuzzling, with snouts as responsive to touch as our fingertips. It is tempting to suggest that dinosaurs in this period were humanized, were it not for the fact that, because they preceded us, it feels more accurate to say that traits we now associate with personification were dinosaurized by these findings.
Such developments have not always been met with enthusiasm. As has been remarked of many developments in the study of animal behavior, the disappearance of any supposedly unique human trait into the commons of zoology puts culture at stake as much as science. In 2022 The Sun criticized the BBC’s plans to debut—in a different Attenborough show, Dinosaurs: The Final Day—a “‘woke’ version” of the T-Rex, a “gentler” and more “mundane” beast, emasculated by being cast in the role of a scavenger.
Although Alex was initially awed at the lifelike semblance of Prehistoric Planet’s protagonists, this other kind of realism—dinosaurs portrayed without drama, not fighting, just being animals—soon began to weary him. A pair of plucky little Zalmoxes got caught on a raft of root-bonded soil and floated off as castaways to colonize an island. We scanned forward to watch Beelzebufo, a gigantic toad, crouch in a pool of water to amplify its rumbling croak. No blood, guts, or glory. Shortly after Alex went outside to kick a ball down the driveway.
In the time since I’d last seen him and his brother they’d outgrown their dinosaur phase and, according to my sister, were now preoccupied by a schoolyard trinity of footballers’ haircuts, Fortnite, and a canned energy drink called Prime that was perhaps illegal. She had cautioned me when I’d first proposed watching the series, but I’d forgotten, and my forgetting was a source of some sadness to me both because I remembered my own childhood obsession with dinosaurs as a much more prolonged, vivid episode and because each time I visited my hometown it seemed my nephews had leaped forward into a new era with concerns that were less and less a part of our shared habitual range. I’d wanted to impress on Alex that what we were watching was not just ancient, it was futuristic, with visual effects so advanced and naturalistic that the technology was sure to be deployed, if it hadn’t been already, in the hyperreal environments of the multiplayer games that were now his favorite settings in which to spend an afternoon.
To those of us born in the tapering of the twentieth century, dinosaurs are likely to occupy a special place in memory: as an early experience of mastery. Forming and retaining hierarchies turns out to be a distinct stage of brain development related to pattern recognition, memory, and language, and dinosaurs offer a ready miscellany for sorting. Meat eaters versus plant eaters; those that walked on two legs, those that walked on four. For older children, lizard-hipped dinosaurs unalike to bird-hipped dinosaurs.
Such exercises in categorization can, of course, be undertaken with zoo creatures, fruit, or Pokémon. That dinosaurs especially attract this kind of attention is a consequence not only of the history of paleontological discoveries but of the evolution of manufacturing. When die-cast collectibles dominated the toy market, a manufacturer of playthings might have fabricated just three or four dinosaur miniatures: a T. rex, a Triceratops, a sail dinosaur, perhaps a pterodactyl. Innovations in cheap injection molding and colorfast polymers permitted toy companies to exploit children’s impulse for categorization by extending the range of available models. It was the age of thermal plastic that turned loving dinosaurs into a recognized phase of childhood development.
As a rite of passage, learning to identify dinosaurs—repeating the arcana of their multisyllabic names, as if they were, of themselves, spells for getting taller—can seem bundled with a child’s burgeoning autonomy. Are dinosaurs not, then, the most anthropocentric animals, being props for our development? They may have died out long before we evolved, but what other class of animal has been so thoroughly recruited to the process of growing up?
In conceiving of the full-scale dinosaur sculptures at the Crystal Palace in Victorian London, the early paleoartist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins formed his ideas around studies of comparative anatomy, along with prevailing opinions on the past’s primordial character. Yet though these notions were advanced for their time, they were necessarily compromised by the available building materials: clay casts, bricks, cement and tiles, mortar, cast-iron rods and wrought-iron bands, cast lead, stonework, and weatherproof paint. The belly-crawling postures of several of the prehistoric creatures helped distribute the heavy weight of their fabrication. One of the Iguanodon was constructed to double as a dinner hall. Eleven men gathered to eat eight courses inside its torso on New Year’s Eve 1853; the chief scientific adviser overseeing the Iguanodon’s design, Richard Owen, sat where its brain would be—as though to command it as his avatar.
Prehistoric Planet relies on our familiarity with older technology to give its advanced CGI the gloss of truth. Extinct animals sometimes appear as if from the standpoint of drones and nest-cams, in time-lapse and slo-mo. Night vision discloses a juvenile Triceratops lost in a belowground network of caves. Thermal imaging illuminates a huddle of Imperobator exhaling puffs of steam (we’re reminded that these Antarctic dinosaurs were warm-blooded). Call this skeuomorphism: the sentimental or surplus mimicry of a mechanical feature within a digital one—the way that programmers have added the sonic effect of a snapping lens shutter to phone cameras—naturalizing the novel technology by wrapping it in the trappings of the old.
Of course the illusion created by the intimation of a thermal camera is not only that we are able to see living dinosaurs but that we can peer into how they are alive: their pulse, their breath, the heat of their flesh—everything lost from a cold fossil. Inside the burrow of an Adalatherium—an early egg-laying mammal akin to a badger—the intimate proximity suggests motion-activated cameras installed discreetly in the earth, intended to capture candid footage of a creature unaware of being surveilled. Another sequence emulates camera equipment embedded within carrion about to be picked over by two pterosaurs—risky animals to get close to, presumably. Where potentially dangerous meat eaters are the focal point, blurred foreground details suggest the concealment of the camera operator, perhaps in a blind erected for the purpose.
Large herds of prehistoric megafauna are viewed as though from a super-telephoto lens mounted on an on-shoulder rig. Stampeding dinosaurs, and those that soar swiftly through the air, sometimes momentarily outpace the tracking, running or dive-bombing beyond the frame of the shot—a lag that signals the limits of the reflexes of even the most adroit wildlife cinematographer and the apparent spontaneity of the animals’ movement. Paradoxically, what makes a world without people feel real is the anthropocentric perspective: those telltale signs of human presence, human error, and human creativity, failing to fully erase themselves (or, in this case, deliberately imitated). Like Owen poised in the head of the Iguanodon statue, we are taken in by the fantasy of entering the dinosaur’s world without leaving ourselves behind.
Nature documentary has of late become a haunted genre. Watching other offerings from the BBC’s Natural History Unit in recent years (The Blue Planet, Planet Earth), I have found myself preoccupied by a disquieting inner monologue: How have they cut this footage to avoid seeing power lines, cargo ships, smog, contrails? Amazing, to have scouted a beach on which there appears to be no rubbish—has it been pre-cleaned, or maybe post-cleaned, scrubbed of a few stray bits of trash in an editing suite? Amazing, to have scouted a forest still so teeming with life—are the birdcalls I’m hearing now the real sounds of that place today, or are these birds recorded somewhere else, decades ago?Amazing, that this night sky seems to be without light pollution. The exotic animals in these documentaries begin to appear vaguely ghostly—fading, or since faded, from view.
Amid woeful biodiversity loss, the nature documentary’s agenda in the 2020s is to insist on animals being interesting and beautiful, and therefore worth protection. Not so Prehistoric Planet, which revels in portraying that which is already dead and gone, no longer our responsibility. In fact, never our responsibility. No Stegosaurus ever choked on a shopping bag. No ichthyosaurexpired in the sludge of an oil spill. A documentary liberated from these regrets and worries frees the audience to appreciate nature’s abundance with unalloyed joy—the way we perhaps did as children, or in decades when threats to animals appeared, for the most part, to be localized, piecemeal, and solvable.
The adult watcher of Prehistoric Planet might also find herself nostalgic for a time before the climate change “debates,” when science seemed to have greater authority and the projection of the world it offered suffered less from bargaining and predatory skepticism. A short presentation (Prehistoric Planet: Uncovered) appears as a coda to each episode, scrutinizing an aspect of the preceding show: “Was Pachycephalosaur Really a Headbutter?” “How Fast Was a Mosasaur?” But when Alex rejoined me for one of these, he was less curious about the factual plunges into paleontological research than about the show’s digitally enhanced Cretaceous. As was I. If there was ambiguity about the feats of world-building I’d been drawn into, I didn’t want to hear about it. Let paleontology be an uncontentious science. Let these visions of the planet be uniting, not divisive.
If prehistory can be believably reconstructed, then why not digitally revitalize environments nearer to the present day? Prehistoric Planet portends a possible future for nature documentary as a genre embracing the simulation not just of the far past but also of environments that are within living memory. Environments replete with realistic wildlife, their cries and calls AI-replicated—perhaps as these very species are actively being edited out of their real natural habitat. What is our tolerance for such illusions? Will that threshold shift the more our hunger for contact with animals goes unmet, in this time E.O. Wilson called “the age of loneliness”? Are the interests of a living tiger better served by the creation of a synthetic tiger than they are by having a film crew fly across the planet to set up camera traps in its territory or trail that animal with drones? And as to our interests, as an audience: Are we moved so very differently, beholding the real thing?
Needless to say, natural places with no trace of human activity can still be found, though by virtue of their seclusion and obscurity, those that flourish unadulterated seem to belong more and more to the realm of the fantastical. Remove the animals from Prehistoric Planet and it becomes an eerie montage of landscapes unfazed by mass extinction: windless ravines, flatlands of smoking volcanic soil and pumice stone, salt playas, low-nutrient plains in the open ocean. A sampler of places that will in all likelihood outlast us. Was it not unsettling to shoot these elemental environments with an eye to their emptiness? In the planning stages, devising the storyboards, did this series not present itself as a test of how far we have to go to completely disappear?
Though it is common to talk of dinosaurs as having disappeared from the world, to the last of the dinosaurs it was the world that ceased to be. In Otherlands: A Journey Through Earth’s Extinct Worlds, Thomas Halliday—paleobiologist, Scot—sets out to illuminate a series of prehistoric ecosystems, several of them on the cusp of destruction, or in nascent recovery, following a world-sundering event. Whether by inundation or mudslide, meteoric impact, runaway climate change, ocean acidification, or volcanic eruption, these installments of the deep past are far from Edenic: they are scenes of life put sideways by chaos.
Starting in the northern plains of Alaska, on the windblown steppe of Beringia (roamed by mammoths, those mammoths pursued by cave lions), each chapter leads further into the past, taking up a different site on the supple surface of the planet. From 20,000 years ago back to 550 million, the continents unstitch along their tectonic boundaries and shuttle to and fro, coalescing for mere epochs into the vast landmasses of Laurasia and Gondwana. Nameless mountains crop up, then fan out as topsoil and harden to dribbles of color threaded through granite.
Halliday’s trajectory builds toward the primordial origins of multicellular life and to a time when all organisms yet to evolve (up to and including those extant today) were bottled up in a single mysterious species scientists call LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor. As the book progresses, anything with a backbone gradually retreats into the water, where, over innumerable generations, skeletons jellify and dissolve inside bodies. Animals lose their faces, next their symmetry, become apparently less sentient and animate.
Conceiving of these squashy, zestful things, I found myself drawn to frame their existence in introspective terms as the slowest riddles nature ever posed: When was sleep dreamed up? Where does atmosphere end and breath begin? What is oneness? Life way back may prove impossible to anthropomorphize, being both too strange and too devitalized, and yet such creatureliness still seems to define questions pertinent to living in a human body.
Having rewound to the seedbed of life, we find a planet so unfamiliar that viewing it as belonging to another universe might prove less befuddling. The oceans are anoxic. Aquatic slime with the nap of rhinoceros skin crinkles the seafloor, while fleshy quills cadge microbes from the currents. A day scampers by in twenty-two hours. Stars have slid off their bases. Overhead, the moon blazes—large and rough as a cantaloupe, twelve thousand kilometers nearer and some 15 percent brighter than it is at its modern-day perigee.
Halliday is a part of the next generation of paleontological scientists, those whose hours are spent less on fieldwork and more “in basement museum collections and within computer algorithms,” as well as in laboratories furnished with state-of-the-art machines. In Otherlands he confects a series of documentary scenes that play out in the present tense for each of the temporalities he takes up. A gorgon with a toothache trudges over dunes flash-lit by lightning in the Permian. By the banks of a Carboniferous creek, an ancestor of the horseshoe crab, Euproops,fiddles in silt. Doughy Devonian bollards stoop, Narcissus-like, over opalescent pools—“a platoon of half-melted grey snowmen” that are, in fact, colossal fungi, ancestrally related to both truffles and Penicillium.
Otherlands is filled with rich descriptions of lands before language:
Short willows write wordless calligraphy on the wind with flourished ink-brush catkins, while dwarf birch shrubs hide ptarmigans. Above, skeins of snow geese wing and cry their way to the sea. In autumn, the more sheltered parts of Beringia shine with a pouring of molten gold as the cottonwoods and aspens turn yellow, set off by the blue-green of tall spruce.
A herd of prehistoric ponies is a “schiltrom of hooves and teeth.” Light falling into the sea, each wavelength disappearing at a set depth, is “a rainbow slowly being consumed.” Here and there our attention is drawn to traces of an older world in a time frame that is already distant from our own. Under the shade of Triassic trees a cobble-size block of limestone cracks open to reveal the coiled shells of long gone sea-things: a fossil in its adolescence. Sometimes geological features of our present day loom out of the backdrop: a volcano not yet called Ben Nevis, for instance, its ridgelines streaming with molten lava.
We walk with eldritch creatures throughout. Grabsnouts, bear-otters, moon-rats. Horses as little as house cats. Two-kilogram dormice, as large as a bag of apples. A terrifying plurality of sharks. Sharks inland, in lakes in the mountains; sharks that might have migrated like salmon, up rivers from the sea. The first bird to have a beak. Their frightful descendants: man-size, forest-dwelling, nocturnal penguins. Grasshoppers the size of guinea pigs. Yet Otherlands offers more than a wondrous bestiary. Ecosystems beget ecosystems, the evolution of organisms contextualized by shifting conditions so that we begin to see that our ancestry owes not just to a chain of mammalian animals but to sequential environments.
Those among us who retain only a trivia-night gist of prehistoric succession (did the Ordovician come before or after the Triassic?) will find that the reverse-chronological ordering of life in Otherlands offers surprises. The Great Pyramid of Giza had existed for generations before the last mammoths perished. A longer interval passed between the lives of the last Diplodocus and the first Tyrannosaurus than between that last Tyrannosaurus and our birth. Diplodocus inhabited a world without flowers and grasses. Basilosaurids, an early whale, could listen to the sounds of the ocean, but was unable to reply—it couldn’t yet sing. Horseflies pre-date horses, monkey-puzzle trees evolved before monkeys, shipworms before ships. The Ordovician comes first.
A thick rendition of prehistory emerges from Halliday’s book, including food webs, meteorology, seasonality, energy and nutrient flows, circadian rhythms, migration, disease and parasite transmission, population structure, relationships of competition, opportunism, predation, and mimicry. His environmental sensibility feels especially needed given the tendency of popular accounts to spotlight the lives of charismatic megafauna—with all of Cretaceous life, for example, captured by “the reign of T-Rex”; the Ordovician known as “the age of jawless fish”—while granting scant attention to coexisting kingdoms of microbes and minifauna, fungi, plant life, and insects.
Punctuating the timeline, the world-forging cataclysms are sensationally bad news. Following the impact of the asteroid at Chicxulub, in the Yucatán of modern-day Mexico, Halliday observes: “For three quarters of species on Earth, every male, every female, every adult and every child is dead.” Earlier still, when massive eruptions in Siberia are believed to have jacked up carbon dioxide and triggered a cascade of changes, “ninety-five per cent of all species on Earth will perish in what will become known as the Great Dying.” Ninety-five percent, imagine. What slips beneath the door slammed shut by chaos, to excite a new age?
Homo sapiens is not the first species to confront the unmaking of a habitable future. The disruptions of our time may be less obliterating than those delivered by an asteroid six miles in diameter, but we nonetheless share a kinship with prehistoric beings living through an apocalyptic transition. “The world that we inhabit is changing at the level of the landscape,” Halliday writes in his introduction. “Compared with the radical environmental upheavals of the geological past, what might we expect to happen in the near and more distant future?” This question pricks the fabric of the chapters to follow, though the author won’t give it his sustained attention until the book’s conclusion.
Just as we are coming to reckon with the reality that what is lost is gone forever today, so too are we gaining a deeper appreciation for the vast array of survival tactics life has at its disposal; this is the ultimate message of Otherlands. Mass perishing is followed by incremental, improbable vitalization. Halliday describes a postextinction world repopulated by “disaster taxa”: opportunist organisms, some of them preserved because of their habitat (perhaps protected in burrows), others their life cycle (capable of lying dormant, as do fern spores), a few merely because they were common and widespread (Halliday gives the example of salamanders). He points out that life is able to cope with extreme change, but not at a rapid pace. Corridors of escape define survival. The book is, he writes, “a lesson in the adaptability of life,” but also “that of our own world’s impermanence.”
Last year Otherlands was short-listed for the UK’s Wainwright Prize for Nature Writing, and nature writing is, indeed, its rightful genre. It’s a genre that has long fetishized not just solitariness but self-erasure, and on this account Otherlands might prove to be the purest form of nature writing there is. We are each piloted through a world of wilderness and nothing else, nature and nothing less—who wouldn’t expect to grow a little enchanted by their own disappearance in that context? Where there are not yet human ears to hear it, the highest waterfall ever to exist rumbles over a ledge. Where no human legs stride, soft mosses collect “so deep as would sink an unwatchful step.” Maybe, too, we covet the obliviousness of the animals we meet, these creatures on the edge of an ending, for here nothing that is the last of its kind knows it.",,The New York Review of Books,Tree Fern,,,0.0,0.8,"Wildlife, Climate and Energy, Forests, Other",Other,"Tree Fern (Cyathea spp.), Other",English

…Awards between them, alongside countless other accolades, Karine Polwart, Kris Drever, Julie Fowlis, Seckou Keita, Rachel Newton, Beth Porter, and Jim Molyneux (alongside former member Kerry Andrew) had set the bar extremely high. Spell Songs: The Lost Words was a Featured Album of the Month on Folk Radio What was once a lone idea, nurtured and given wings, is now a mass murmuration of fledgling imaginings, liberated by a like-minded band of dreamers, while The Guardians glowing appraisal of Let the Light In concluded that the record represented a magical return to nature. Inspired by and drawing heavily upon the bestselling books The Lost Words and The Lost Spells, which combine the timeless words of Robert Macfarlane and evocative watercolours of Jackie Morris, Spell Songs brings nature centre stage with stirring odes to birds, mammals, trees, insects, and even the humble dandelion. Spell Songs makes us consider our innate connection to nature through the means of music, art, and words, reflected Molyneux in a previous interview with Folk Radio.
Gifts of Light plucks the best of the best from these rich pickings, achieving the perfect balance between the two albums, with the magical addition of the Otter spell, a particularly memorable section of the live show where Jackie Morris paints a stunning portrait of two otters from scratch, accompanied by a relaxing instrumental interlude from the group. Throughout the album, each musician is given time to shine on lead vocals bolstered by well-balanced harmonies and world-class instrumental backing from woodwind, percussion, and strings, including the exceptional talent of Newton on harp and Porter on cello. The album kicks off with Fowlis haunting Bird of the Blizzard, one of several beautifully understated tracks celebrating avian life, alongside Newtons calming Curlew and Molyneuxs gentle gem, Little Astronaut.
Porter picks up the pace with her quirky Charm On, Goldfinch, inspired by the antics of the lively feathered residents of her quaint Scottish home town, Wigtown. Keita rounds off this lovely celebration of all things winged with his Heron spell. This, the albums most unabatedly joyful addition, with heavy influences from his native Senegal, including lyrics in Mandinka and Keitas masterful playing of the kora, forces the listener to adopt a colourful new perspective on what some of us in Britain might previously have viewed as a rather austere-looking grey bird. Here hunts heron, here hunts heron!, I can now often be caught exclaiming emphatically to whichever unfortunate soul has agreed to accompany me on any riverside walk, but Keitas writing was predominantly inspired by the brown-and-white variety, which can commonly be seen standing on the backs of grazing cows in Senegal. On the record, gentle laughter can be heard at the beginning of this track as the tight-knit group of friends relishes every moment of making music together after such a long time of being forced to stay apart.
Drever injects a raw, mammalian contribution into the record with Red is your Art, his powerful, perfectly-written ode to the fox, pre-released as a single alongside Polwarts iconic Heartwood. In addition to this flora-inspired track, which gives voice to the mighty tree, appealing to the axeman for its life, Thrift (Dig In, Dig In) later spotlights the oft-neglected, humble little thrift clinging to the rocks and roadsides. For Polwart ever the champion of the beauty and value to be found in the small and the feisty and Macfarlane, whose words inspired the song, this is a plant whose survival not only demonstrates that hardship is a limit not a failing, but also teaches us how to live in hope against the odds, two of the most moving lines in the entire Spell Songs repertoire. This track is the high point of the album, not purely because of Polwarts exceptional songwriting and lead vocals, but also because the unique power of this live performance, with the vocal harmonies accompanied only by percussion and body percussion, is conveyed effortlessly through the recording, mixed and engineered by the expert hand of producer and all-round folk hero Andy Bell.
What better way to round off this musical delight than with the Lost Words Blessing, a track not only all-encompassing in terms of the cast of natures characters visited but also in terms of the musical talent of the group. Featuring some of the albums most stunning harmonies from all four female voices, with Drever, Keita, and Molyneux accompanying on guitar, kora, and piano respectively, this moving lullaby draws upon numerous spells from The Lost Words, including Fern, Kingfisher, Grey Seal, Heather, and Raven, to name just a few, in what has rightly become a staple of all Spell Songs performances. Polwart said of the blessing, written collectively around Molyneuxs piano, that it was offered to the listener in both hope and light, and in grief for the losses and dark times yet to come, an astoundingly prophetic statement given the release of the first album just months before the pandemic. For Robert Macfarlane and Jackie Morris, the intermingling of the groups existence with the unprecedented social restrictions that resulted has produced music which echoes with both joy and sorrow, unafraid of sombre themes such as climate change, loneliness, and grief. At the confluence of light and dark, Gifts of Light is characterised by an uplifting vitality which soothes the soul, demonstrating the magic that results from combining live music with art and literature and representing collaborative music-making at its very finest. — folkradio.co.uk

Nature Picture Library / Alamy Stock PhotoMad honey is made by Himalayan giant honey bees, the world’s largest honey bees.
Hidden high up in the Himalayan mountains of Nepal and in the Black Sea region of Turkey is a psychedelic substance known as “mad honey.” This unusual elixir is made by the world’s largest honey bees, Apis laboriosa, which feed on native rhododendron plants containing neurotoxins that give the honey its psychoactive effects.
To reach the remote beehives where the honey is produced, hunters climb hundreds of feet up steep cliffs, often with little protective clothing while suffering untold numbers of painful bee stings. Those who eat it may experience dizziness, disorientation, euphoria, and even hallucinations, and many have used it as a spiritual aid to achieve deeper awareness and insight. 
Dive into the origins of mad honey to see why this mystical substance has become a hot commodity today. 
The Psychedelic History Of Mad Honey
Wikimedia CommonsMad honey can be found in the mountains of Nepal and Turkey.
People have enjoyed the psychedelic properties of mad honey for at least 2,400 years. One of the earliest recorded encounters with this substance comes from Xenophon, a Greek military leader and commander of one of the largest mercenary armies of the Achaemenid Empire. 
According to Big Think, Xenophon mentions the honey in his book “Anabasis,” in which he writes of a peculiar situation his army faced in 401 B.C.E. after consuming honeycombs in the Turkish city of Trabzon. 
Apparently, the honey caused many of the soldiers to experience a bad trip, making them sick and extremely disoriented. Xenophon notes that some of them lay on the ground in “general dejection” for several days.
“The number of bee-hives was extraordinary, and all the soldiers that ate of the combs, lost their senses, vomited, and were affected with purging, and none of them were able to stand upright,” Xenophon wrote. “Such as had eaten only a little were like men greatly intoxicated, and such as had eaten much were like mad-men, and some like persons at the point of death.”
A similar encounter took place years later, in 67 B.C.E., when Pompey the Great and his Roman army were chasing Persian troops along the Black Sea. Knowing the Romans were on their tail, the Persian army intentionally left behind pots full of mad honey for the Roman army to find and indulge in. After eating it, the Romans became so disoriented that the Persians handily defeated them, killing over 1,000 Roman troops.
But for the people who understand mad honey best, its effects can be incredibly spiritual and healing.
The Ancient Tradition Of Honey Hunting

For the Gurung people of Central Nepal, where mad honey is abundant, honey hunting has been a centuries-long tradition. For generations, they have used this substance for medicinal remedies as well as spiritual purposes. In fact, the honey hunters of Gurung risk their lives every year to extract the honey from the Himalayan cliffs. 
To reach this rare prize, honey hunters climb rope ladders hundreds of feet up steep cliffs to find the beehives where it’s produced. After first sedating the bees with smoke, they use long bamboo sticks to remove the hives from the cliff walls and then drop them into a basket below, all the while remaining calm despite enduring painful bee stings.

After the honey has been extracted, those present for the hunt gather around to share and enjoy it. That’s when its unusual effects kick in.
The Risks And Benefits Of Taking Mad Honey
While traditional honey offers several medicinal benefits, like acting as an anti-inflammatory agent and easing sore throats, mad honey takes it a step further. 
According to a study published in the journal RSC Advances, mad honey has been employed as an alternative treatment for conditions like diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, and arthritis. This substance is also said to enhance physical and mental performance and serve as a powerful aphrodisiac. 
Because mad honey contains the active compound grayanotoxin, it can also act as a psychedelic. Those who eat it may experience euphoria and even hallucinations. Some who’ve indulged in mad honey have reported feeling less stressed and more in-tune with their surroundings. 
L. Shyamal/Wikimedia CommonsHimalayan giant honey bees feed on rhododendron plants, which contain the neurotoxins that give mad honey its psychoactive properties.
Though these effects may seem enticing, it’s crucial to note that consuming mad honey also comes with significant risks. 
Grayanotoxin, the same ingredient that causes mad honey’s hallucinogenic effects, can also cause disorientation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, loss of muscle control, irregular heart beat, and even temporary paralysis, depending on both the amount of honey you consume and your individual sensitivity.
However, while these reactions can last up to 24 hours, mad honey poisoning is very rarely fatal. Still, anyone interested in trying it should research the potential health risks and consume with caution. 
Mad Honey’s Rise In Popularity
ZUMA Press, Inc. / Alamy Stock PhotoHoney hunters typically leave behind a third of the hive so bees can repopulate it for the next season.
While honey hunting is a centuries-old tradition in the Himalayas, in recent years this substance has become sought after in certain circles in the West because of its mind-altering effects. Due to this global spike in interest, mad honey is now available to purchase via a number of online stores. 
While mad honey is legal in the U.S., many countries have banned it due to its intense psychoactive properties. As a result, it has also appeared on the black market, where it can go for close to $60 to $80 per pound, according to Atlas Obscura. 
Whether you’re curious about mad honey’s medicinal properties or looking to have a spiritual adventure, experts recommend that anyone interested in sampling this natural elixir buy it from a verified seller to ensure a safe experience.

Why do such tunnel collapses occur? Are there safeguards that could mitigate the impact?The Himalayan region is full of geological faults and shear zones, which often have hard rocks that are fractured and weakly joined or stacked upon one another. Detailed and very careful geological investigations are required before undertaking any infrastructural activity in such regions. There should be minimal or no room for surprises during construction. But this road-widening project was a hurried job the prime minister came in December 2016 and announced out of the clear blue sky that there would be this Char Dham Pariyojana, and (highways minister Nitin Gadkari said) that it would be completed in two years. He clearly had no idea what all was required to widen 900 km in the Himalayas but he made this grand announcement. The pressure comes on the engineers at workthey rushed through the project without caring two hoots for adequate geological investigations. This fact was repeatedly emphasised by the high-powered committee and these were unanimously recorded.There was a crying need to undertake environmental impact assessment (EIA) because the region is not only geologically sensitive, it is also a critical region ecologically. An EIA would have brought out some of these aspects. An EIA also includes a disaster management plan. Since the EIA was not done for this project, there is no disaster management plan as far as I can see and the evidence of the last few weeks bears this out. Also, typically, for a long tunnel like this, you would provide adits, which are entry points. If an adit is provided, particularly in the case of a disaster, you can often access the area through it but it seems theres no adit here.Then, some basic geological investigation that was done revealed that about 50% of the rock in the area was of weak quality. The slope also had limestone in it. If there is limestone and there is a forest cover of oak and rhododendron on top, which releases water into the soil, when the water dissolves the limestone, it creates cavities in the rock. They should have been doubly careful in doing this work. Finally, this project also violated the ministry of road transports notification of March 2018, which made it very clear that all national highways in the mountains would have a width of 5.5 m. This tunnel is 13.5 m wide. The more width you cut into the slope, the greater the possibility of mishaps and disasters.
Is there a possibility of more such accidents occurring during the remainder of the construction of the Char Dham project?Its not so much with this project alone there are many more tunnels in the railway project (the Char Dham railway line). And I hear madcap statements that we will now take the railways to Badrinath. These ministers have no idea of the geology of the stretch from Joshimath to Badrinath.What are the main ecological risks from the project?We had highlighted the issue of inadequate attention being paid to the fragility of the Himalayan region, both geologically and ecologically. In our final report to the SC in July 2020, you can see how many times we have referred to this. There are 35 important recommendations that were unanimously made. There is also a larger issue of the quality of our engineering education. Eight-ten years ago, I was part of a committee set up by the All-India Council for Technical Education and I had made the point that ecology should be a compulsory subject for all branches of engineering. Engineers have no idea about ecology, and that to me is very critical.The major issue over which you resigned from the committee was the widening of highways. What will be the impact of having wider highways in the region?Its already happening. First, the more you cut into a slope, the higher the possibility of exposing weaknesses. Second, the security walls that are built are inadequate and we have shown many photographs in the reportyou have a 30-40 m slope with a security wall of about 3 m. Then, when you ultimately get to the shrine, the valleys are extremely narrow. Essentially, you are in a canyon. If you take hundreds of vehicles into a canyon, a lot of exhaust will be generated. On the one hand you complain of glaciers melting and how you have to prevent that and, on the other, you are increasing that. Precious vegetation is also critical. Currently, there is a plan to widen the road from Uttarkashi to Gangotri, a 100-km stretch that is in the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone, where no destruction has taken place. In that, they plan to cut 10,000 deodhar trees deodhar trees dont grow overnight. There has been a lot of criminal neglect in the whole process of design and construction of the widening of these roads.This has been a difficult year for Uttarakhand from the Joshimath subsidence to flooding to the tunnel collapse. What is the sentiment among residents towards mega projects?In the past, I would have said its a mixed reaction. Now, I think people are becoming more concerned, that this is too much. The frequency of such accidents will only increase, because of climate change.",the-times-of-india,The Times of India,Rhododendron,,,1.0,0.8,"Climate and Energy, Forests, Governance",Other,Rhododendron (Rhododendron spp.),English

आगामी मार्च ८ तारिख अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय महिला दिवसका अवसरमा ‘वुमन युनाइटेड फर क्लाइमेट जस्टिस’ भन्ने नारासाथ विभिन्न विधाका प्रतिष्ठित २७ महिलाले काठमाडौंदेखि कालापत्थरसम्म झण्डै १२ दिनको पदयात्रा गर्न लागेका हुन । ‘साथसाथै’ नामक संस्थाको संयोजनमा हुन लागेको सो पदयात्राको मुख्य उद्देश्य हिमाली क्षेत्रमा जलवायु परिवर्तनका कारणले परेको असर विश्वसामु उजागर गर्न र त्यसले महिलामा उत्पन्न गरेको समस्याको न्यायका लागि वकालत गर्ने रहेको छ । साथै जलवायु परिवर्तनका कारणले हिमाली क्षेत्रमा हिउँ पग्लने क्रम बढेको, जलवायु अनुकूलन र जलवायु परिवर्तनबारे महिलालाई सचेतना जगाउनेलगायत उद्देश्य छ ।
समूहले कालापत्थरमा विशेष कार्यक्रम गर्ने र त्यहीबाट जलवायु परिवर्तनका असरले महिलामा पारेका असरको उजागर गर्ने तथा त्यस्ता मुद्दाको राष्ट्रिय, अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय रुपमा ध्यानाकर्षण गराइने ‘साथसाथै’ का कार्यक्रम संयोजक प्रजिता कार्कीले जानकारी दिइन् । ‘त्यहीबाट नेतृत्वको झण्डा बोकेर सबै प्रकारका विभेदविरुद्ध चेतना फैलाउने र शान्तिपूर्ण र समृद्ध समाजको प्रवर्द्धन गर्ने अभियानमा जुट्छौं’, उनले भनिन् ।
स्थानीय महिलासँग सहकार्य गर्ने र कालापत्थरको उचाइबाट जलवायु परिवर्तन प्रभावित महिलाको आवाज उठाएर विश्वलाई सन्देश दिने अयिभानको उद्देश्य रहेको उनले बताइन् । प्रकृतिसँग घुलमिल हुँदै आन्तरिक पर्यटन प्रवर्द्धनका लागि अरुलाई पनि प्रोत्साहन गर्न र जलवायु परिवर्तनको प्रभाव उजागर गर्ने उद्देश्य राखेर ‘साथसाथै’ संस्थाले यस अघि मर्दी हिमाल क्षेत्रका साथै अन्नपूर्ण आधार शिविरमा यसैगरी पदयात्रा सम्पन्न गरिसकेको जनाएको छ ।
विश्वमा हरित ग्यास उत्सर्जनले तापमानमा आएको वृद्धिसँगै जलवायु परिवर्तनका विविध असर देखिने गरेका छन् । हरित ग्यास उत्सर्जनमा नेपालको भूमिका नगन्य भए पनि बढ्दो तापमान र जलवायु परिवर्तनका असरबाट नेपाल सबैभन्दा बढी प्रभावित मुलुकको सूचीमा रहेको छ । यस विषयलाई पनि विश्वको ध्यानाकर्षण गराउने महिला पदयात्रा अभियानको उद्देश्य रहेको छ ।
पछिल्लो अध्ययनअनुसार सन् २०१० सम्मको अवधिमा हिमालमा हिउँको भण्डार झण्डै २९ प्रतिशतले घटेको र हिमतालको सङ्ख्या ११ प्रतिशतले बढेको देखिन्छ । पृथक भौगोलिक अवस्था र विभिन्न उचाइमा अवस्थित पारिस्थितिकीय क्षेत्र, प्राकृतिक स्रोतमा आधारित जीविकोपार्जन, गरिबी, सिमान्तकृत समुदाय र न्यून क्षमताका कारण नेपाल विश्वकै सवैभन्दा सङ्कटापन्न र जोखिमयुक्त मुलुकमध्येमा पर्न गएको देखिन्छ ।",,https://www.onlinekhabar.com,,1.0,0.0,0.3,0.9,"Climate and Energy, Governance, Other",Sacred Himalayan Landscape,"Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia), Red Panda (Ailurus fulgens), Rhododendron (Rhododendron spp.)",Nepali

कोवाङ, लार्जुङ, बोक्सीखोला र नाउरीकोटको शिरमा रहेको मानापाथी हिमालबाट हिमपहिरो खसेको थियो । हिमपहिरोपछि भागदौड हुँदा एक दर्जन स्थानीय घाइते भएका छन् ।
आइतबारको हिमपहिरोबाट प्रभावित नाउरीकोट गाउँको घरभित्र पसेको हिउँ पग्लिएर हिलाम्मे भएको छ । घरको छाना र आँगनमा सुकाएको बिस्कुन तथा खेतबारीको अन्नबालीमा पनि हिमपहिरोले क्षति पुगेको स्थानीयले बताएका छन् । आखिर हिमपहिरो किन र कसरी जान्छ त ?
सामान्यतया कम तापक्रम हुने हिमाली भेगमा एकै ठाउँमा धेरै हिउँ थुप्रिएपछि त्यो कुनै न कुनै बेला अस्थिर भएर पहिरो खस्नु नै हिमपहिरो हो । भिरालो क्षेत्रमा धेरै हिउँ जम्मा हुँदा एकैपटक हिउँ खसेर बेलाबेलामा ठूलो धनजनको क्षति पुग्ने गर्छ । हिमपहिरोमा ९० किलोमिटर प्रतिघण्टासम्मको गतिमा हिउँ बग्ने गर्छ । यो भौगोलिक अवस्था अनुसार तलमाथि हुन्छ । हिमपहिरोबारे पूर्वानुमान गर्न नसक्ने भएकाले यसबाट अनपेक्षित रुपमा ठूलो मानवीय क्षति समेत पुग्ने गरेको विगतका तथ्यांकहरुले देखाउँछन् ।

सय वर्षमा हिमपहिरोमा ३७२ जनाको मृत्यु
नेपालमा पछिल्लो एक शताब्दीको अवधिमा ६० वटा ठूला हिमपहिरोको रेकर्ड गरिएको छ । जसबाट ३७२ जनाको ज्यान गएको विभिन्न अध्ययनको तथ्यांकमा उल्लेख छ । सरकारी एवं गैरसरकारी सरोकारवाला निकायले तयार पारेको तथ्यांकको आधारमा ‘ग्लासिकल हाजार्ड एण्ड एभलेचेज इन हाइ माउन्टेन अफ नेपाल हिमालय’ नामक अनुसन्धानमूलक आलेखमा जलवायु परिवर्तनले गर्दा पछिल्ला दशकहरुमा हिमपहिरोको जोखिम बढेको अध्ययनको निष्कर्ष छ । यो अध्ययन त्रिभुवन विश्वविद्यालय वातावरण विज्ञान केन्द्रीय विभागका सहप्राध्यापक सुदीप ठकुरी (पीएचडी) सहित त्रिभुवन विश्वविद्यालय वातावरण विज्ञान केन्द्रीय विभागमा कार्यरत राजु चौहान र सोही विभागमा कार्यरत प्रेसिका बास्कोटाले गरेका थिए ।
सो आलेखमा सन् १९२२ देखि २०२० सम्मको तथ्यांक समेटिएको छ । जर्नल अफ टुरिजम एण्ड हिमालय एड्भेन्चर नामक जर्नलमा सन् २०२० को जुनमा प्रकाशित सो रिपोर्ट अनुसार साना-ठूला गरी पछिल्लो एक दशकको समयलाई हेर्दा कुल ६५ वटा हिमपहिरो गएका छन् । जसमध्ये २०१२ मा ९, २०१३ मा ८, २०१४ मा १६, २०१५ मा २३, २०१७ मा एउटा र २०१९ मा ८ वटा हिमपहिरो गएको देखिन्छ । तर यी सबै हिमपहिरोमा मानवीय क्षति भएको रेकर्ड भने भेटिँदैन । ठकुरी भन्छन्, ‘हिमपहिरो समय-समयमा गइरहने प्राकृतिक प्रकोप हो । तर, मानवीय क्षति पुगेको हिमपहिरोमा मात्रै चासो धेरै हुने भएकाले नियमित गइरहने हिमपहिरो समाचारको विषय नबन्ने गरेको उनी बताउँछन् ।

किन जान्छ हिमपहिरो ?
हिमालमा मुख्यतया हिमपहिरो जाने प्राकृतिक र मानवीय कारण हुन्छन् । बढी हिमपात हुने र हावाले गति परिवर्तन गर्दा पनि हिमपहिरो जाने गर्छ । यसबाहेक विभिन्न विकासे कामले हिमालमा कम्पन उत्पन्न गर्ने एवं मानवीय गतिविधि बढ्दै जाँदा पनि हिमपहिरोको जोखिम बढ्ने गरेको ठकुरी बताउँछन् ।

क्यानडाको सिमोन फ्राजर विश्वविद्यालयले गरेको एक अध्ययनले हिमपहिरो जानुमा मुख्यतया ७ वटा कारण जिम्मेवार रहेको देखाएको छ । जसमध्ये एउटा हो हिमआँधी एवं हावाको गति । हिमपहिरोको दोस्रो कारण उच्च हिमपात हो । कमजोर ठाउँमा बढी मात्रामा हिमपात हुनु पनि हिमपहिरोको कारण रहेको विश्वविद्यालयको रिपोर्टमा उल्लेख छ ।
विश्वविद्यालयको रिपोर्टअनुसार मानवीय गतिविधि, तरंग एवं हिउँको तहले पनि हिमपहिरोलाई प्रभावित बनाउँछ । यसबाहेक भिरालो ठाउँ तथा बढी तापक्रम पनि हिमपहिरो जाने कारण रहेको विश्वविद्यालयको रिपोर्टमा उल्लेख छ ।",,https://www.onlinekhabar.com,,1.0,0.0,0.8,0.7,"Climate and Energy, Forests, Governance",Other,Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia),Nepali

हालसम्मको नतिजालाई हेर्दा नेपालमा सन् १९९५/९६ मा ९३ देखि ९७ वटासम्म बयस्क बाघ रहेको अनुमान गरिएको थियो । सन् २००९ मा १२१, सन् २०१३ मा १९८ र सन् २०१८ को सर्वेक्षणअनुसार २३५ वटा बयस्क बाघ रहेको अनुमान गरिएको थियो । सन् २०१८ मा गरिएको बाघ गणनामा नेपालमा २३५ बयस्क बाघ फेला परेका थिए । त्यतिबेला चितवनमा ९३, बर्दियामा ८७, पर्सामा १८, शुक्लामा १६ र बाँकेमा २१ बाघ फेला परेका थिए । यो सङ्ख्या बढेको अनुमान छ ।
बाघ सर्वेक्षणको वन तथा वातावरणमन्त्री रामसाहयप्रसाद यादवले स्वचालित क्यामेरा सञ्चालन गरी शुभारम्भ गरेका थिए । नेपालका चितवन, बर्दिया, पर्सा, शुक्लाफाँटा र बाँके राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्ज र आसपासका राष्ट्रिय वन क्षेत्रमा बाघ पाइन्छ । ती क्षेत्रमा गणना गर्न सुरु गरिएको हो ।
सन् २०१० मा रसियाको सेन्ट पिटर्सबर्ग भएको बाघ पाइने १३ मुलुकका राष्ट्र प्रमुखहरूको बाघ सम्मेलनमा नेपालले सन् २०२२ सम्ममा बाघको सङ्ख्या २५० पुर्‍याउने प्रतिवद्धता व्यक्त गरेको थियो ।
तत्कालीन समयमा नेपालका निकुञ्जमा १२१ वटा बाघ रहेको तथ्याङ्क थियो । दोब्बरभन्दा बढी सङ्ख्या बनाउने नेपालको प्रतिबद्धता तत्कालीन प्रधानमन्त्री माधवकुमार नेपालले गरेका थिए ।
नेपालमा हरेका चार/पाँच वर्षको अन्तरमा बाघ गणना गर्ने गरिन्छ । अहिले निकुञ्ज र वन क्षेत्रमा बाघको चहलपहल बढी देखिएसँगै यो सर्वेक्षणसँगै बाघको सङ्ख्या बढेको तथ्याङ्क आउने विज्ञहरुको अनुमान छ ।
निकुञ्जमा घुम्न आएका पर्यटक र संरक्षणकर्मीले बाघ देखेको जनाउँदै आएका छन् ।",,https://www.onlinekhabar.com,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,"Wildlife, Forests, Governance",Chitwan Annapurna Landscape,Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris ssp. tigris),Nepali

नेपालमा पहिलो पटक टोर्नाडो
नेपालको इतिहासमै पहिलो पटक बारा र पर्सा जिल्लामा आएको ‘टोर्नाडो’ले २८ जनाको ज्यान लियो । वर्षको अन्तिम महिना चैत १७ गते साँझ आएको टार्नाडोले बारा पर्सामा झण्डै १ हजार २ सयभन्दा बढी घर पूर्ण रुपमा ध्वस्त बनायो । १ हजार ३ सय भन्दा बढी घरहरु आंशिक रुपमा क्षति भए । झण्डै १ हजार १ सय ५५ जनाभन्दा बढी घाइते भए ।

घाइते भएकामध्ये केहीको अझै पनि उपचार भइरहेको छ । हावाहुरीबाट ११ पुरुष, ११ महिला, २ जना बालक र ४ जना बालिकाले ज्यान गुमाएको गृहमन्त्रालयको तथ्यांकमा उल्लेख छ । 
भूमरीसहितको हावाहुरीले घर, बस, ट्रक तथा गाडिएका ट्युबेल समेत उडाइदियो । हावाहुरीसँगै कतिका सपना उडे, कतिका घरबार ।  नेपालमा योभन्दा अघि यस्तोखाले हावाहुरी आएको थिएन । 
बाढी पहिरो, चट्याङ 
वर्ष २०७५ मा बाढी पहिरोका कारण ८८ जनाले ज्यान गुमाएका छन् । देशका विभिन्न भागमा आएको बाढी पहिरोले यस्तो क्षति पुर्याएको हो । वस्ती माथिबाट आउने पहिरोले घर पुरिँदा मानवीय क्षति हुने गरेको छ ।  यस्तै यो वर्ष चट्याङले पनि ६७ जनाको ज्यान लिएको छ । चट्याङका कारण ३ सय ९७ जना घाइते भए । 
चट्याङबाट सबैभन्दा धेरै मकवानपुरमा ७ जनाले ज्यान गुमाए, डडेलधुरा ४, उदयपुर, प्युठान र अर्घखाँचिमा ३÷३ जना, अछाम २ र दाङ १ जनाले ज्यान गुमाएका छन् ।  यस वर्ष आगलागी परेर ८७ जनाले ज्यान गुमाउनु पर्‍यो भने अन्य प्राकृतिक विपत्तिमा ३२ जनाले ज्यान गुमाएको गृहमन्त्रालयको तथ्यांकमा उल्लेख छ । 
३ वटा हवाइ दुर्घटना 
यो वर्ष हेलिकप्टर दुर्घटनामा देशले महत्वपूर्ण व्यक्तिहरु गुमाएको छ । २ जेठ २०७५ मा मकालु एयरको कार्गाे विमान हुम्लाको बाहुनखर्क भन्ने स्थानमा दुर्घटना भयो । विमानमा अन्य यात्रु नहुँदा विमानका पाइलट किरण भट्टराई र कोपाइलट आदित्य नेपालीको मृत्यु भयो । 
यस्तै भदौ २३ गते गोरखाको सामागाउँमा अल्टिच्युड एयरको हेलिकप्टर दुर्घटना भयो । यो दुर्घटनामा ५ जनाको मृत्यु भयो भने १ जना बाँच्न सफल भए ।

बाँकेको राप्ती सोनारी गाँउपालिका-७, फत्तेपुरका किसानहरु पुरानो प्रविधिबाट खेतीगर्दा उत्पादनमा कमी भएपछि मजदुरी पेशामा लागेका थिए । तर कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्र बाँकेमार्फत् उक्त वडामा स्र्माट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम लागू भएपछि किसान पुनः कृषि पेशामा फर्केका हुन् ।
सो गाउँपालिका कृषि पेशामा होमिएको गाँउपालिका हो । तर पुरानै विधि र प्रविधिअपनाएर कृषिगर्दा उत्पादनमा कमी आएको थियो । लगानी र मिहिनेट बढी लाग्ने तर उत्पादन कम भएको कारणले किसानहरु कृषि पेशाबाट पलायनभई दैनिक ज्यालादारी मजदुरी काममा लागेका थिए ।

नेपाल सरकारले २०७५ सालदेखि बाँके जिल्लामा कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्रमार्फत् स्मार्ट कृषि गाँउ कार्यक्रम सञ्चालन गरेपछि किसानहरु उत्पादन देखेर पुनः कृषि पेशामा फर्केका छन् ।
कृषि उत्पादनका लागि कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्रले हरेक सिजनमा र हरेक बर्षमा किसानहरुलाई ५० प्रतिशत अनुदानमा कृषि समाग्री दिने र प्याकेट क्षेत्रका लागि मलबीउहरु पूर्ण रुपले ज्ञान केन्द्रले दिएपछि थप हौसला आएको राप्ती सोनारी गाँउपालिका-७, फत्तेपुरका किसान चक्रबहादुर थारुले बताए ।

बर्षामा धान, हिउँदेमा आलु मात्रै उत्पादन गरिरहेका किसानहरु २०७५ सालदेखि सबै महिना खेती गरिरहेका छन्। स्मार्ट कृषि गाउ कार्यक्रम लागु भएपछि अहिले १ सय ७ घर धुरीले सिजनअनुसार खेती गरिरहेका छन् ।
बर्षातमा धान, हिउँदेमा आलु र तोरी र बसन्तमा मकै खेतीगरि रहेका छन् । तर नेपाल सरकारबाट स्वीकृत भएका मकै भारतीय मकै जस्तो उत्पादन नभएपछि उनीहरु भारतीय मकैको बिउमानिर्भर परेको फत्तेपुर स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँका किसान तथा सचिब खोज लालथारुले बताए ।
तराईको भेग र बाँकेको माटो उर्वर भएको कारणले मकै उत्पादननिकै राम्रो भैरहेको छ । स्मार्ट कृषि गाँउ कार्यक्रम लागू भएदेखि नै फत्तेपुरका किसानहरु पूर्ण रुपमा कृषिमा आबद्ध भएको कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्रका अधिकृत दिनेश भट्टराईले बताए ।

यस क्षेत्रमा उत्पादन हुने चाँद, ताला ११ जिरो सात, जेपी पाँच सय दुई जातका मकै अहिले बसन्त सिजनमा ९ बिगाहा जमिनमा मकै खेती गरेको अधिकृत भट्टराईले बताए ।
राप्ती सोनारी गाँउपालिकाले स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँका किसानहरुलाई आर्थिक सहयोग नगरे पनि प्राविधिक रुपमा किसानहरुले खबर गर्न साथ सहयोग गर्दै आएको गाँउपालिकाकी कृषि प्राविधिक सुमित्रकुमारी थारुले बताए ।
नेपाल सरकारले मान्यता दिएको मकै धेरै समय लाग्ने, घोघा लामो भएपनि कम दाना लाग्ने, धेरै अग्लो हुने र उत्पादनमा कमीआएको कारणले किसानहरुले भारतीय मकैको बिउ लगाउने गरेको उनले बताए ।

यसरी स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ स्थापना भएर किसानहरुले लागेको देख्दा हरेका गाउँपालिकाको वडा स्तरमै स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ सञ्चालन गर्न जरुरी देखिन्छ । वडा स्तरमै स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम लागू भएपछि विदेश पलायन हुन लागेका युवाहरुलाई स्वदेशमै रोजगारीको अवसर दिई आत्मनिर्भर बनाउन र कृषि उत्पादनमा वृद्धि हुने देखिन्छ ।",,https://www.onlinekhabar.com,,1.0,0.0,0.8,0.3,"Governance, Other",Other,Other,Nepali

सरकारले मध्यवर्ती क्षेत्रमा पर्यटकको सेवा–सुविधा उपलब्ध गराउन होटेल, रिर्सोट तथा होमस्टे सञ्‍चालनको अनुमति दिएको छ ।
नेपालका राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्जमध्ये सबैभन्दा बढी व्यस्त निकुन्ज चितवन र बर्दिया हुन् । महालेखा परीक्षकको कार्यालयले आर्थिक वर्ष २०७८ मा वातावरणीय लेखा–परीक्षणतर्फ यी दुई राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्जबारे अध्ययन गरेको छ ।
अध्ययन अनुसार नेपालको पर्यटन र विदेशी मुद्रा आर्जनमा यी राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्ज निकै सहयोगी बनेको देखिएको छ । साथमा मानव र वन्यजन्तुबीचको द्धन्द्ध भने मूख्य समस्याका रुपमा देखिन थालेको छ । निकुन्ज आसपासमा होटेल, होमस्टे, जीप सफारी, हात्ति सफारी, क्याम्पिङ, र्‍याफ्टिङ, ढुंगा सयरजस्ता गतिविधि सञ्चालनमा छन् ।
कुन निकुञ्‍जमा कति आतिथ्य सेवा ?
विवरण
विदेशी पर्यटकको आगमनका दृष्टिकोणबाट चितवन राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्ज तेस्रो मूख्य पर्यटकीय गन्तब्यका रुपमा रहेको छ । पहिलो स्थानमा काठमाडौं र दोस्रो स्थानमा पोखरा पर्छ । कोरोना भाइरसको महामारीभन्दा अगाडी चितवनले मात्र एक वर्षमा ७८ हजार ७ सय ५५ जना तेस्रो मुलुक (सार्कबाहेक)का पर्यटकलाई स्वागत गरेको थियो ।
बर्दिया राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्जमा भने एक वर्षको अवधिमा ५ हजार विदेशी पर्यटक पुगेको तथ्यांक छ । चितवन राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्जले दिएको तथ्यांक अनुसार आर्थिक वर्ष २०७६-७७ मा कुल १ लाख ८२ हजार ४ सय ३५ जना आन्तरिक तथा बाह्य पर्यटकले निकुञ्जको भ्रमण गरेका छन् । यसमध्ये सार्क मुलुकका पर्यटक १४ हजार २ सय ३९ रहेका छन् ।
उता, बर्दिया राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्जले भने एक वर्षको अवधिमा आन्तरिक, सार्क र विदेशी गरि कुल १५ हजार २ सय ६० जना पर्यटकलाई स्वागत गरेको छ । महालेखाले समेत कोभिड १९ महामारी भन्दा अगाडीसम्म निकुञ्जहरुमा पर्यटक आगमन बढ्दै गएको देखिएको बताएको छ ।

संरक्षित क्षेत्रमा हुने पर्यटकीय गतिविधिले जैविक विविधताको संरक्षण, स्थानीय जनताको जीवनस्तर सुधार्न सहयोग, स्थानीय संस्कृतिको सम्वद्र्धन, स्थानीय उत्पादनको उपयोग भने हुनुपर्ने महालेखाले उल्लेख गरेको छ । होटेल सम्बन्धी मापदण्ड २०७० अनुसार पर्यटकीय रिसोर्टहरु घना आवादी भएको क्षेत्रबाट टाढा खोल्नुपर्छ । ढल र फोहोर खुला पानीमा मिसाउन पाइदैन ।
तर बढ्दैछ मानव-वन्यजन्तु द्धन्द्ध
मधयवर्ती क्षेत्र नजिकै मानवीय गतिविधि बढ्ने, निकुञ्जमा वन्यजन्तुको संख्या बढे अनुसार आहारा नपाउँदा जोखिम समेत बढेको अध्ययनले देखाएको छ । महालेखा परीक्षकको वातावरणीय लेखा परीक्षण प्रतिवेदन अनुसार प्राकृतिक वास्स्थानमा खलल पुग्दा, पर्याप्त वासस्थान र आहार नहुँदा वन्यजन्तु बास र आहारको खोजिमा आफ्नो क्षेत्रभन्दा बाहिर निस्कने गरेका छन् । वन्यजन्तु बाहिर निस्कँदा बालीनालीमा मात्र नभई मानवीय क्षति समेत हुने गरेको छ ।
चितवन राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्जमा वन्यजन्तुका कारण ५ वर्षमा कति मानिसको मृत्यु ?
निकुन्ज आसपासका मानिसहरुले तरकारी, घाँस–दाउरा, च्याउ, निगुरोजस्ता वस्तुको खोजीमा जाँदा समेत वन्यजन्तुको आक्रमणमा पर्ने गरेको भन्दै महालेखाले यस्तो अवस्थाबाट जोगाउन भने जनचेतनामा वृद्धि गर्नुपर्ने बताएको छ ।

चितवन राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्जले आर्थिक वर्ष २०७६/७७ मा मात्र वन्यजन्तुका कारण भएको क्षतिको भर्पाईस्वरुप १ करोड ७८ लाख ४६ हजार रुपैयाँ वितरण गरिसकेको छ ।
पर्या–पर्यटनमा कमजोरीको चाङ
निकुन्ज क्षेत्रमा सञ्चालित होटेल, रिर्सोट तथा होमस्टेमाथि निगरानी बढाउन नसक्दा पर्या–पर्यटनमा जोखिमसमेत उत्तिकै देखिएको छ । प्रतिवेदन अनुसार दिगो तथा पर्यावरणमैत्री पर्यटकीय क्रियाकलाप अभिवृद्धि गर्न पर्यटन तथा संरक्षण सम्बन्धी कार्यक्रम संचालन नगरेको देखिएको छ ।

327,,विदेशबाट फर्किएका बर्दघाट-सुस्तापूर्वका युवा कृषि प्रवर्द्धनमा,,https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2022/03/1088875,,२०७८ फागुन २० गते १३:०८,"२० फागुन, नवलपुर। लामो समयसम्म विदेशी भूमिमा बसेर सिकेका सीप र ज्ञान स्वदेशमा नै प्रयोग गर्दै नवलपरासी (बर्दघाट-सुस्तापूर्व)का युवा उद्यमी बन्दैछन् । यहाँका केही युवाले आफूहरू जस्तै विदेशी भूमिबाट फर्किएका ‘रिटर्नी’हरूलाई आबद्ध गरेर संस्था स्थापना गर्दै दीर्घकालीन काम अगाडि बढाएका छन् ।
विदेशमा रहँदा सिकेको ज्ञान र सीपलाई स्वदेशमा लगाएर ‘समृद्ध नेपाल, सुखी नेपाली’को सरकारी नारा सफल बनाउने उद्देश्यले तिनले ‘रिटर्नी माइग्रेन्ट नेपाल’ नामक संस्था स्थापना गरेका छन् ।
वैदेशिक रोजगारीबाट स्वदेश फर्किएका नेपालीले सो संस्थामार्फत व्यावसायिक हुनका लागि ‘रिटर्नी कृषि तथा पशुपालन कम्पनी लिमिटेड’ दर्ता गरेर करोडौँको योजना अगाडि सारेका छन् ।
वैदेशिक रोजगारीबाट फर्किएका श्रमिकलाई सीप र क्षमतानुसारको रोजगारीको व्यवस्था गर्न निजी तथा सरकारी निकायसँग परामर्श गर्ने, उनीहरूको हितका लागि राज्यसँग समन्वयकारी भूमिका निर्वाह गर्ने र विभिन्न अभिमुखीकरण कार्यक्रम तथा सीपमूलक तालिम सञ्चालन गर्ने उद्देश्यले संस्था स्थापना गरिएको कम्पनीका अध्यक्ष नेत्रनारायण थनेत थारुले बताए ।
विभिन्न सङ्घसंस्थासँग समन्वय गरी वैदेशिक रोजगारीबाट फर्किएका नेपालीको सामाजिक हित संरक्षणका क्षेत्रमा काम गर्नका लागि सहयोग गर्न पहल गर्ने संस्थाको मुख्य उद्देश्य भएको उनको भनाइ छ ।
‘विदेशबाट फर्किएका तर आफ्नै पुँजी लगानी गर्न नसकेर भौँतारिइरहेका पूर्वप्रवासी श्रमिकलाई सीप र क्षमता अनुसारको रोजगारीको व्यवस्था गर्ने संस्थाको योजना छ’, अध्यक्ष थनेतले बताए । कम्पनीमार्फत चिस्यान केन्द्र, एग्रो फार्म, एग्रो मार्ट, दूध प्रशोधन केन्द्र, एग्रो रिसोर्ट एण्ड रिसर्च सेन्टर निर्माणलगायत परियोजना अगाडि सारिएको छ ।
कम्पनीले जिल्ला सदरमुकाम कावासोती-१४ स्थित अग्यौलीमा १६ कठ्ठा जमिनमा रु २० करोड लागतमा चिस्यान केन्द्र, मध्यविन्दु–१४ मा ११ बिघा जग्गामा रु एक करोड २० लाख लागतमा फलफूल तथा तरकारी खेती, कावासोती–१५ गोडारमा एक बिघा जमिनमा रु पाँच करोड लगानीमा २५ हजार लिटर क्षमताको दूध प्रशोधन केन्द्र तथगा एग्रो रिसोर्ट र कृषि सम्बन्धी रिसर्च सेन्टर निर्माण गर्ने गरी काम अघि बढाएको छ ।
कम्पनीका चिस्यान केन्द्र संयोजक भीमबहादुर महतो थारुले संस्थाले आफ्नो पहिलो परियोजनाका रूपमा नवलपरासी (बर्दघाट–सुस्तापूर्व)मा रिटर्नी कम्पनी संस्था दर्ता गरेर काम सुरु गरेको बताए ।
उनले कम्पनीमार्फत संस्थाले विदेशबाट फर्किएका तथा नेपालमा नै बसेका किसानसँग रकम उठाएर जिल्लाकै सबैभन्दा ठूलो चिस्यान केन्द्र निर्माण सुरु गरेको जानकारी दिए । रु २० करोड लागतमा देशभरका ३०० भन्दा बढी युवाको लगानीमा अग्यौलीमा तीन हजार मेट्रिक टन क्षमताको चिस्यान केन्द्र निर्माणको काम सुरु गरिएको बताइएको छ ।
चिस्यान केन्द्र निर्माणको काम तीव्र गतिमा अगाडि बढिरहेको छ । आगामी दुई वर्षभित्र चिस्यान केन्द्र सञ्चालन गरिसक्नेगरी काम अगाडि बढाइएको जनाउँदै भीमबहादुरले भने, ‘चिस्यान केन्द्रमा ५०० मेट्रिक टन क्षमताका समान ६ वटा चेम्बर रहनेछन् । एउटामा माछामासु, एउटामा २५ टन क्षमताको अटोमेसन मस्रुम कल्टिभेसन र बाँकी चार चेम्बरमा फलफूल तथा तरकारी राख्ने गरी निर्माण अगाडि बढाएका छौँ।’
मस्रुम कल्टिभेसनबाट डल्ले च्याउ उत्पादन गरिने छ । च्याउको बीउ राखिएको ४० दिनपछि प्रतिदिन १०० किलोका दरले ९० दिनसम्म उत्पादन आउँछ । चिनियाँ प्रविधिमा आधारित मस्रुम कल्टिभेसनबाट गुणस्तरीय धेरै उत्पादन हुने उनको भनाइ छ ।
कम्पनीका प्रबन्ध निर्देशक दीपेन्द्र महतोले संस्थाले सञ्चालन गर्न लागेको चिस्यान केन्द्रमा तीन वटै सरकारको लागत सहभागिता रहेको बताए । सरकारको ५० तथा संस्थाको ५० प्रतिशत लगानीमा चिस्यान केन्द्र निर्माणको काम सुरु गरिएको दीपेन्द्रको भनाइ छ ।
दुबईका विभिन्न वायर हाउसमा काम गरेर स्वदेश फर्किएका नेपालीले नवलपुरमा बन्दै गरेको चिस्यान केन्द्रको व्यवस्थापनको काम हेरिरहेको उहाँले जानकारी दिनुभयो । चिस्यान केन्द्रसहित कम्पनीले ञ्चालन गर्न लागेको सबै परियोजनामा रिटर्नीले व्यवस्थापन हेर्ने छन् ।
स्थानीय कृषकले उत्पादन गरेका ताजा फलफूल तथा तरकारी चिस्यान केन्द्रमा राखेर आवश्यक परेका समयमा बिक्री गर्ने उद्देश्यले काम सुरु गरिएको हो ।
आफूहरू दुबईको वायर हाउसमा काम गरेका समयमा अन्य देशबाट आएका फलफूल तथा तरकारी ल्याएर वायर हाउसमा राख्ने र बिक्री गर्ने गरिएको देखेर नेपालमा पनि त्यस्तै काम गर्ने सोचका साथ फर्किएको दीपेन्द्रले बताए ।
कम्पनीका बजार अधिकृत रेशम खत्रीले चिस्यान केन्द्रको काम अगाडि बढाइएसँगै यसमा लगानीयोग्य रकमको अभाव नहोस् भन्ने हेतुले सर्वसाधारणका लागि सेयर खुला गरिएको जानकारी दिए । कम्पनीमा सेयर सदस्य हुनका लागि रु १० हजार देखि रु ५० लाखसम्म लगानी गर्न सकिन्छ ।
साधारण, प्रमोटर र संस्थापक गरी तीन प्रकारको सेयरमा लगानी खोलिएको भए पनि अहिले संस्थापक सेयर बन्द गरिएको छ । बाँकी दुई प्रकारका सेयरमा स्वदेश तथा विदेशमा रहेका नेपालीले लगानी गर्न सक्ने खत्रीको भनाइ छ । चिस्यान केन्द्रको पर्खाल निर्माणको काम सकिएर सिभिलको काम पूरा गर्दा करिब रु तीन करोड ३५ लाख खर्च भएको छ ।
जिल्लामा हालसम्म ठूला चिस्यान केन्द्र नभएकाले कृषकले उत्पादन गरेका तरकारी तथा फलफूल कुहिएर खेर गएका कारण आफूहरूको पहिलो परियोजनाका रुपमा चिस्यान केन्द्र रहेको खत्री बताउँछन् । ‘कम्पनीले अहिले कावासोती बजारमा एग्रो मार्टसमेत सञ्चालनमा ल्याइसकेको छ’, खत्रीले भने, ‘हामीले एग्रो मार्टका लागि ट्रेड मार्कसमेत ल्याएका छौँ, खाद्यान्न आयात-निर्यात गर्ने गरी सरकारबाट स्वीकृति पाइसकेका छौँ।’
जिल्लामा हालसम्म ठूला चिस्यान केन्द्र सञ्चालनमा आउन नसकेका भए पनि साना कोल्ड रुम भने तीन वटा छन् । कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्र नवलपुरका अनुसार देवचुली नगरपालिका–१३ दलदलेमा देवप्रगति बहुउद्देश्यीय सहकारी संस्थाले २० टन क्षमताको कोल्ड रुम सञ्चालनमा ल्याएको छ ।
त्यस्तै मह सङ्कलनका लागि देवचुली-९ रावल चोकमा १० टन क्षमताको कोल्ड रुम तथा मध्यविन्दु–३ मा टिस्यु कल्चर बिरुवाका लागि १० टन क्षमताको कोल्ड रुम सञ्चालनमा आएका छन् ।
जिल्लामा उत्पादित ताजा तरकारी तथा फलफूल याममा नै बिक्री हुने गरेको भएर हालसम्म चिस्यान केन्द्रको खासै आवश्यकता नपरेको कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्रका सूचना अधिकारी शङ्कर पौडेलले बताए । जिल्लामा धान, गहुँ, मकैलगायत खाद्यान्न बालीको उत्पादन राम्रो हुने गरेको उनको भनाइ छ ।
त्यस्तै तरकारी तथा फलफूल उत्पादनका दृष्टिकोणबाट जिल्लामा केरा, कागती, सुन्तला, आँप, आलु, काउली, बन्दा, टमाटर, काँक्रोलगायत उत्पादन हुने गरे पनि उत्पादनले बजार धान्नै नसकेको पौडेल बताउँछन् ।
‘जिल्लामा मौसमी तरकारी तथा फलफूल उत्पादन हुने तर ती अपुग रहेका कारण कोल्ड स्टोरमा राख्नुपर्ने अवस्था सिर्जना भएको छैन’, सूचना अधिकारी पौडेलले भने, ‘यद्यपि आलुसहित केही तरकारी भने जिल्लामा धेरै उत्पादन हुने भएकाले पछिल्लो समय कोल्ड स्टोरको आवश्यकता देखिन थालेको छ ।’
पछिल्लो समय जिल्लामा अदुवा, बेसार, अलैँची, प्याज, लसुनलगायत खाद्य पदार्थसमेत उत्पादन राम्रो हुँदै गइरहेको पौडेलले बताए । कृषकले उत्पादन गरेका बाली उत्पादनपछि बजारसम्म पुर्‍याएर गुणस्तरीय बनाई लामो समयसम्म बिक्री गर्नका लागि चिस्यान केन्द्रको भूमिका महत्वपूर्ण हुने उनको भनाइ छ ।
नवलपुरमा ५३० हेक्टर क्षेत्रफलमा केराखेती हुँदै आएकामा प्रतिवर्ष १२ हजार २०० मेट्रिक टन उत्पादन हुने गरेको छ । त्यस्तै २९० हेक्टरमा आँपखेती हुँदै आएकामा एक हजार ७२५ मेट्रिक टन, तीन हजार ११५ हेटर क्षेत्रफलमा हुँदै आएको आलुखेतीबाट ५५ हजार २४५ मेट्रिक टन र ९५० हेक्टर क्षेत्रफलमा अदुवाखेती हुने गरेकामा प्रतिवर्ष नौ हजार ९५० मेट्रिक टन उत्पादन हुँदै आइरहेको उनको भनाइ छ । त्यस्तै जिल्लामा ९० हेक्टरमा टमाटरखेती हुने गरेकामा एक हजार ६३० मेट्रिक टन उत्पादन हुने गरेको छ ।
यहाँ हिउँदे तरकारी बढी उत्पादन हुने गरेको छ । वर्षैभरि काँक्रो पनि उत्पादन हुँदै आएको छ । जिल्लाका हुप्सेकोट–१ जुकेपानी, मध्यविन्दु १ र २ तथा कावासोती–१७ मा बाह्रै महिना काँक्रो उत्पादन हुने गरेको छ । काँक्राले स्थानीय बजार धानेर पनि काठमाडौँमा निर्यात हुने गरेको कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्रले जनाएको छ ।
कावासोती नगरपालिका प्रमुख चन्द्राकुमारी पुनले बिदेसिएका नेपाली स्वदेश फर्किनु र बिदेसिने तयारी गरेकालाई स्वदेशमा नै सम्भावना देखाउन लाग्नु निकै प्रेरणादायी भएको बताइन् । ‘वैदेशिक रोजगारीमा आर्जेको सीप र ज्ञान आफ्नै माटामा प्रयोग गरेर आत्मनिर्भर बन्ने र देशलाई समृद्धिका बाटामा अगाडि बढाउन सहयोग पुर्‍याउने रिटर्नीहरूको उद्देश्य सराहनीय छ’, पुनले भनिन् ।
आफूहरू कृषिप्रधान देशको नागरिक भए पनि यसमा मात्रै निर्भर हुन सक्ने अवस्था भने नभएको जनाउँदै पुनले कृषिलाई निर्वाहमुखी पेसाका रूपमा मात्रै लिइँदा यसबाट भरपूर उत्पादन र फाइदा लिन नसक्नु दुःखद भएको बताइन् ।
कृषिलाई अगाडि लैजानका लागि स्थानीय तहले समेत विभिन्न योजना बनाएर अगाडि बढ्नुपर्ने अवस्थामा रिटर्नीले चिस्यान केन्द्र निर्माण गरेर कृषिलाई प्रबद्र्धन गर्न खोज्नु प्रशंसनीय भएको नगर प्रमुख पुनले बताइन् ।
नवलपुरमा हालसम्म व्यवस्थित कृषि बजार तथा ठूलो चिस्यान केन्द्रको अभाव छ । चिस्यान केन्द्रका लागि चितवनको भर पर्नुपरेका अवस्थामा जिल्लामा नै चिस्यान केन्द्र निर्माण हुने भएपछि व्यावसायिक कृषक खुशी भएका छन् ।
अग्यौलीमा तीन हजार मेट्रिक टन क्षमताको चिस्यान केन्द्र निर्माणको काम थालनी गरिएसँगै जिल्लाका किसान उत्पादित कृषि उपजको भण्डारण गर्न अन्यत्र जान नपर्ने भएपछि खुशी हुन् ।
चिस्यान केन्द्र स्थापनापछि कृषि उपजलाई आफ्नै ठाउँमा भण्डारण गरेर राख्न सहज हुने कावासोती–१० का प्रेमबहादुर मुखियाले बताए । जिल्लाका मध्यविन्दु, कावासोती, देवचुली र गैँडाकोट नगरपालिकामा तरकारी खेतीका साथै तराईमा फल्ने मौसमी फलफूलको राम्रो उत्पादन हुने गरेको छ । त्यस्तै हुप्सेकोट गाउँपालिका पनि आलु उत्पादनको मुख्य क्षेत्र मानिन्छ । यहाँको आलु छिमेकी जिल्लामा पनि निर्यात हुँदै आएको छ ।
त्यसैगरी गैँडाकोटसहित यहाँका पहाडी क्षेत्रमा सुन्तला प्रजातिका फलफूलको उत्पादन राम्रो हुने गरेको छ । जिल्लामा उत्पादित तरकारी तथा फलफूल समयमा बिक्री नहुँदा कुहिएर फाल्नु परेको यहाँका कृषकको नमिठो अनुभव थियो ।
‘किसानले उत्पादन गरेको मौसमी तरकारीले बजारमा उचित मूल्य नपाउने समस्याले हामी हैरान भएका छौँ”, मुखियाले भने, ‘चिस्यान केन्द्र निर्माणपछि भने उत्पादित तरकारी भण्डारण गरेर पछि बेच्दा उचित मूल्य पाउनेमा हाम्रो आशा जागेको छ ।’ बारीमा उत्पादित मौसमी तरकारी बेमौसममा बेच्न पाइने भएको हुँदा उचित मूल्य पाउने आफूहरूको विश्वास रहेको मुखियाले बताए ।
जिल्लामा उत्पादित तरकारी तथा फलफूल बाहिर जिल्लाका चिस्यान केन्द्रमा राख्दा लागत बढ्ने गरेको मुखियाको भनाइ छ । आफ्नै जिल्लामा चिस्यान केन्द्र बनेपछि भण्डारण गरी बेमौसममा पनि बिक्री गर्न पाइने भएको छ ।
जिल्लामा उत्पादित आलु, सुन्तला, अमिलो, प्याजलगायत कृषि उपज र हिमाली क्षेत्रको स्याउसमेतको यहाँ भण्डारण गरेर बेमौसममा बिक्री गरी अम्दानीमा वृद्धि गर्न सकिने मुखिया बताउँछन् ।
किसानले चिस्यान केन्द्रलाई आफ्ना उत्पादन बेच्न सक्नेछन् भने भाडामा लिएर आफ्ना सामान राख्न चाहनेका लागि पनि सेवा उपलब्ध हुने बताइएको छ ।",,https://www.onlinekhabar.com,,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.5,"Governance, Other",Other,Other,Nepali

As a group of mourners were making their way through Kherwa village after attending a funeral, a terrifying swarm of honey bees began to viciously attack.
The furious horde launched their attack on the unsuspecting travelers as dozens attempted to flee from the scene in a bid to save their lives.
But instead, they were chased as the bizarre incident unfolded in the streets.
In a shocking turn of events, one man tragically lost his life while four others suffered injuries following the encounter.
A man named Bondar Singh died after being hit with the sheer force and venomous stings of the bees in the midst of the terrifying onslaught.
Meanwhile, the four other mourners left seriously injured were rushed to a nearby hospital in Barwani, where they received urgent medical attention.
The district's Bag police station in-charge, Kailash Chouhan, expressed his deep sorrow over the tragic loss of life and the suffering endured by those affected.
According to a survivor of the attack, the day was already bleak as the group was saddened after having just performed funeral rites in the sacred Muktidham.
And nothing could have prepared them for their journey home that soon transformed into a living nightmare.

D'Emic,How Sauropod Dinosaurs Became the Biggest Land Animals Again and Again,New research hints at how sauropod dinosaurs got to be so gargantuan,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-sauropod-dinosaurs-became-the-biggest-land-animals-again-and-again/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/AA9C29A8-3E8F-43C3-927CB6B876737086.jpg,2023-08-15T13:00:00Z,"Of all the animals ever to have roamed the planet, the iconic long-necked, long-tailed dinosaurs known as sauropods stand unrivaled. No other terrestrial creatures have come close to attaining their colossal sizes. They overshadowed all other dinosaurs, from the duck-billed hadrosaurs and the horned ceratopsians to the armored ankylosaurs and predatory tyrannosaurs. Even the mightiest land mammals—mammoths and rhinoceroslike beasts that were up to twice as heavy as the largest elephants alive today—were featherweights compared with the biggest sauropods.
From an evolutionary perspective, this singularity makes sauropods an intriguing anomaly. Evolution is rampant with examples of convergence, in which the same feature evolves more than once independently in different groups of organisms. A classic example of convergence is powered flight—flapping wings evolved in birds, bats, pterosaurs and insects, but the particular bones or other structures making up the wings differ among the groups, attesting to their independent evolutionary origins. Convergence in evolution is very common even when it comes to complicated features: warm-bloodedness, eyes that can move and focus, bipedal locomotion, the loss of limbs, the use of tools, and live birth all evolved multiple times in different animal groups. Convergence is widespread in the plant kingdom as well: carnivorous plants evolved at least a dozen times, roots evolved more than once, and even arborescence—plants taking the form of trees—evolved more than once. With convergence so common in nature, sauropods' uniqueness in size is special in itself. No other land animal has approached even a third of the largest sauropods' weight. What makes sauropods stand out from the crowd, both literally and figuratively?
Thanks to a wealth of sauropod discoveries over the past few decades, paleontologists are beginning to piece together the answer to this question. Analyses of this burgeoning fossil record reveal where and when these dinosaurs became giants, and the factors that allowed them to evolve extreme sizes again and again over the course of their nearly 150-million-year-long reign. They also suggest that, as mind-bogglingly huge as the largest-known sauropods were, even bigger ones remain to be discovered.
A Growing Fossil Record
Figuring out how sauropods evolved their uniquely enormous sizes has proved challenging because historically they had a relatively terrible fossil record—much worse than that of many other land animals and orders of magnitude worse than that of most animals that live in the sea. The first step in becoming a fossil is burial, and for immense sauropods that would have required an event that could deposit a lot of sediment on the body at once. Think landslides and flash floods, which might take place only a few times a decade or century in a given region, as opposed to the seasonal flooding of smaller streams and rivers that can bury smaller animals multiple times a year. Compounding this problem, landslides and flash floods are violent affairs that scatter the fragile parts of an animal's skeleton. Sauropods had particularly uneven skeletons, combining dense limb bones as thick as tree trunks, vertebrae so riddled with air sacs that they resemble honeycomb, and small skulls composed of sometimes paper-thin bones.

There's a human element holding back the sauropod fossil record as well. A paleontologist can spend a field expedition digging up just a handful of sauropod bones or, in the same amount of time, scout and collect several skeletons of smaller creatures. Likewise, scientists can spend their finite research time in a museum waiting to get a single bone down from a shelf with a forklift or get straight to the business of studying the anatomy of a more sensibly sized animal. With limited time and grant funding, sometimes sauropods are skipped over.
Despite these hindrances, both the sauropod fossil record and our understanding of it have improved greatly over the past few decades. Throughout most of the 20th century, few new sauropods came to light. In the 1990s the situation began to change, as interest in dinosaurs ratcheted up and paleontologists undertook more excavations. Around the turn of the millennium, sauropod discoveries increased quickly. For the past decade researchers have commonly announced around 10 new species each year. With this better sauropod record available, we can finally start to study the evolution of their tremendous sizes.
Tipping the Scale
To figure out why sauropods are so exceptional, we must first understand when, where and how they got that way. Currently there are about 250 sauropod species known from around the globe, and researchers continue to make important discoveries in areas that are relatively unexplored, such as Antarctica, and in areas that have been surveyed for decades, including Australia and North America.

From these new discoveries we know that sauropods' overall body proportions varied quite a bit. Some were slender like giraffes, and others were stocky like elephants. Some had necks that elegantly mirrored their tails, whereas others appeared unsettlingly off-kilter. Some had longer front legs than rear, giving them a stately appearance; others had low-slung shoulders, keeping their necks and heads near the ground. From their footprints we know that some sauropods walked with their legs near the midline like most quadrupeds; others held their legs farther out, like 50-foot-long French bulldogs. This diversity of body forms meant that multiple sauropods could coexist in the same ecosystems, with each species adapted to exploiting different resources within a given setting. We often find more than one sauropod species from a given time and place.
Their diversity of body forms also makes comparing the evolution of body size in terms of length or height tricky, so biologists turn to body mass (or weight) to make more equitable comparisons. Body mass is not just useful for making apples-to-apples comparisons. It also correlates with biologically important features such as metabolic rate, growth rate, nest clutch size, longevity and home range size. In this way, calculating body mass can give us an idea of these features of an extinct animal, so long as we are mindful of how fuzzy or sharp the correlation is.
Several methods exist for estimating body mass in extinct animals. The most popular is based on limb bone dimensions. Think of sauropod limb bones as columns supporting a building. Because the amount of weight supported by a column increases with thickness, we can estimate the mass of a sauropod based on the cross-sectional area of its limb bones. About 200 of the 250 sauropod species on record are known from fossils that include limb bones complete enough to measure this way.
I recently obtained these measurements and used them to chart sauropod body mass evolution. It turns out that over their long history, sauropods evolved a wide range of sizes. The largest include the truly gargantuan, such as the more than 50-metric-ton titanosaur Patagotitan. The smallest, such as the 20-foot-long Magyarosaurus, weighed only as much as a bull. I plotted these species on an evolutionary tree and stretched the tree over time to see when and how many times sauropods increased or decreased their body mass. When they first appeared more than 200 million years ago, they were relatively small—about the size of a rhinoceros. By around 165 million years ago the first giants, non-neosauropods, including the ultralong-necked mamenchisaurids, evolved.
Most sauropods were not exceptional in size compared with the largest terrestrial mammals. Consider Diplodocus, an especially long-tailed sauropod that inhabited western North America around 155 million to 145 million years ago. The Diplodocus specimen known as “Dippy,” replicas of which are exhibited in museums around the world, weighed a paltry 14 tons in life, smaller than the largest mammoths or rhinoceroslike mammals of the past. Dippy's weight is close to the average sauropod body mass. Like Dippy, three fourths of all sauropods weighed less than the largest land mammal.
From this relatively modest stock, I found, sauropods evolved their record sizes a remarkable three dozen times on six landmasses over the course of 100 million years. Sauropods evolved their hallmark sizes early on, and with each new family to evolve, one or more lineages independently reached superlative status. This filling and refilling of the “extremely large body” niche mirrors the pattern seen in land mammals, which evolved very large body sizes quickly in the wake of the dinosaur extinction, before plateauing in the gigantic-mammoth range.

The largest-of-the-large sauropods had differently shaped teeth and heads and distinctively proportioned bodies, indicating that these herbivorous dinosaurs ate different plants and lived in subtly different habitats. In other words, like sauropods in general, the heftiest sauropods occupied somewhat different ecological niches from one another.
The Limits of Evolution
The sheer size of the biggest-known sauropods raises fascinating questions about the limits of evolution: Just how big can animals get on land? And why can't they get bigger than that? Biomechanical studies provide some hints. Mobility decreases as limb bones increase in thickness to support a larger animal's weight, so there is an upper limit to how thick limb bones can be while still supporting a functional animal. From a physics perspective, research by Jyrki Hokkanen of the University of Helsinki suggests that the theoretical limit for terrestrial body mass based on biomechanics is well over 100 metric tons. Over the years, murky reports of a few now-lost fossils have hinted at the existence of sauropods with masses greater than that. But the largest definitive sauropod, the exceptional 75-metric-ton Argentinosaurus, doesn't approach that limit. In addition to biomechanics, factors such as resource and habitat availability and heat dissipation also limit maximum body mass in complex and interacting ways that are difficult to predict. For now all we can say is that terrestrial animals could get at least as big as Argentinosaurus and most likely bigger. It is probably only a matter of time before sauropods larger than Argentinosaurus are discovered.
To reach their record sizes, sauropods underwent record growth. They had the most growing to do of any animal (in an absolute sense), passing through four orders of magnitude in body mass. They had to grow so much not only because their adult body sizes were huge but also because they started out so small. Like other dinosaurs, including modern birds, sauropods hatched from eggs. The larger an egg is, the sturdier the shell needs to be. But evolution can thicken and strengthen eggshell only so much because the shell must allow for gas exchange and the eventual exit of the hatchling. These demands greatly restrict egg size. Sauropod eggs were cantaloupe- to basketball-sized, smaller than those of the biggest birds. Even a 100-foot-long sauropod started out life just a foot or two long. In contrast, placental mammals, which give birth to live offspring, have young that start out relatively large. For example, blue whale calves are around 20 to 25 feet long when they are born, so they must approximately quadruple in length to reach their adult size—a modest task compared to the perhaps 100-fold increase in length set before a hatchling sauropod.

Studies of the bones of several sauropod species have revealed how they accomplished this growth. Just as trees contain rings that can be counted to determine their ages and growth histories, bones contain rings that record a vertebrate animal's age and its rate and duration of growth. Modern-day vertebrates exhibit a variety of growth strategies. Reptiles, including alligators, lizards and turtles, grow relatively slowly, whereas large mammals such as the blue whale grow rapidly. If sauropods grew at the relatively sluggish rates that reptiles do today, it would have taken a century or more for them to reach their immense sizes. Instead, as the growth rings reveal, they grew impressively quickly—on par with the growth rates seen in many large mammals today—attaining adult size in 20 to 50 years.
Sauropods probably needed to grow fast because although adults may have been safe from predators, hatchlings were easy prey that had to compete with other groups of dinosaurs and animals for resources. Unlike large mammals such as whales, which spend years raising each calf, sauropods pursued a quantity-over-quality approach to reproduction, producing lots of eggs and then leaving their young to fend for themselves. Fossils show that at least some groups of sauropods nested in colonies and built their nests quite close together—too close for an adult to pass between—which would have prevented parental care. The faster hatchlings could grow, the better their odds of surviving predators.
That said, sauropod growth rates varied quite a bit from species to species. As sauropods initially evolved larger sizes, they did so by growing faster during annual growth pulses while pausing growth during unfavorable seasons, like most animals do. Later sauropods seem to have further adapted by eliminating or minimizing seasonal pauses and growing quickly throughout the year, according to research carried out by Cecilia Alpadetti of the National University of San Juan in Argentina and her colleagues. Migrating to areas where food was available year-round could have facilitated this sustained growth. A research team I was part of recently showed that some sauropods likely migrated great distances, for example from the Great Lakes region to the Rocky Mountains. The ability to continue growing throughout the year may have been a key innovation, sustained by great migrations, that facilitated the emergence of gigantism in early sauropods.
Why Supersized?
We are only just beginning to understand why sauropods got so big. The answer seems to be complex, with no single way to explain the existence of all of the largest-of-the-large species. Like all dinosaurs, sauropods exhibited a mix of characteristics found in today's reptiles, birds and mammals. A large team led by a group of researchers from the University of Bonn in Germany has shown that some of the sauropods' more “reptilian” traits are probably what allowed them to become the largest animals ever to walk on land. Sauropods had simple teeth incapable of chewing, which meant they could ingest food quickly and ferment it in their gut, as evidenced by their voluminous rib cages. Not chewing also meant they didn't need bulky jaw muscles, so their heads could stay small. That arrangement, in turn, allowed for the evolution of a longer neck, which let them reach wide swaths of food without moving much—a very energy-efficient way of life. Reproducing by laying eggs and not caring for their young allowed sauropods to focus their energy and resources on growth.

Sauropods also independently evolved a birdlike lung with air sacs throughout their bodies, making their breathing more efficient and their bodies lighter for their size. Many large sauropods were upward of 10 percent air inside, overall.
Their long necks and small heads, lack of parental care, and air-filled bodies explain why sauropods are bigger than other land animals in general. But these traits don't explain why 36 lineages within the sauropod group surpassed the other lineages to attain truly epic proportions. Each case seems to have been distinct—predation pressure may have led to the evolution of increased growth rates in one instance, resource abundance could have allowed for extended growth seasons in another—and will require a lot more study to solve.
So much about sauropods is awe-inspiring: they pushed the bounds of biological possibility not once but dozens of times. With an ever improving fossil record, we hope to soon understand some of the evolutionary pressures that led sauropods to become, over and over, the largest land animals of all time.",,Scientific American,Greater One-horned Rhinoceros,,,0.1,0.2,"Wildlife, Other",Other,Other,English

पर्यटन विभागसँगको सहकार्यमा २०५४ सालदेखि एसपीसीसीले सगरमाथाको दोस्रो शिविरसम्म बाटो बनाउने काम गर्दै आएको छ । दोस्राे शिविरभन्दा माथि आरोहण व्यवसायीहरूकै संयोजनमा बाटो बनाइन्छ । हिमनदी र हिउँ खाल्डा तथा खर्पसहरू धेरै रहेको दोस्रो शिविरसम्म हरेक वर्ष संरचना परिवर्तन भइरहन्छ । एक वर्ष बाटो खुलाएको ठाउँमा अर्को वर्ष ठूलो खाल्डो तथा डाँडा बनिसक्ने भएकोले सम्भावित बाटो खोज्ने नयाँ बाटो बनाउनुपर्ने शेर्पाले बताउनुभयो । बाटो बनाउनका लागि भर्‍याङ, डोरीलगायतका सामग्री प्रयोग गरिन्छ । 
यसरी बनाइन्छ सगरमाथामा बाटो  

सगरमाथाको दोस्राे शिविरसम्मको बाटो सगरमाथा प्रदूषण नियन्त्रण समिति (एसपीसीसी) ले बनाउँछ । पर्यटन विभागसँगको सहकार्यमा २०५४ सालदेखि एसपीसीसीले सगरमाथामा बाटो बनाउने काम गर्दै आएको छ । दोस्राे शिविरभन्दा माथि आरोहण व्यवसायीहरूकै संयोजनमा बाटो बनाउँछन् ।
हिमाल आरोहणको सिजन सुरु हुनुभन्दा झन्डै एक महिनाअघि एसपीसीसीले आइसफल डाक्टर (हिउँमा बाटो बनाउने दक्ष कामदार) खटाउँछ । बाटो बनाउन सुरु गर्नुअघि टोलीले सगरमाथाको आधार शिविरमा पूजा गरेर बाटो बनाउन सुरु गर्छन् ।
हिमाली क्षेत्रमा बसोबास गर्ने समुदायहरूले सगरमाथा र अरू हिमाललाई देवता मान्छन् । त्यसैले काममा कुनै समस्या नआओस् भनेर उनीहरूले पूजापाठ गर्छन् । बाटो बनाउनुअघि तथा हरेक समूहले आरोहण सुरु गर्नुअघि बौद्ध परम्पराअनुसार पूजापाठ गर्ने चलन छ । पूजापाठ गर्दा हिमालमा कुल्चनुअघि क्षमापूजा र शक्ति माग्ने आरोही मिङ्मार शेर्पा बताउनुहुन्छ । 
आधार शिविरको उपयुक्त ठाउँमा शिविर स्थापना गरेपछि काम सुरु हुन्छ । हिउँ परिरहने, हिमपहिरो झर्ने लगायतका समस्याहरूको कारण आधार शिविरमा बास बस्ने ठाउँ पहिचान गर्दा निकै ध्यान दिनुपर्ने आरोहीहरू बताउँछन् । बाटो कहाँबाट कसरी तयार गर्ने भन्नेबारे सल्लाह गरेर बाटो बनाउने काम सुरु हुन्छ । आवश्यक ठाउँमा डोरी र भर्‍याङकाे प्रयोग गरेर बाटो बनाइन्छ । 
बाटो बनाउने टोली तीन महिनासम्म आधार शिविरमै बसेर आवश्यकताअनुसार बाटो मर्मतसमेत गर्छन् । दोस्रो शिविरसम्म पुग्ने बाटोमा हिमनदी, खर्पस तथा हिमखाडलहरू धेरै हुने भएकाले हरेक वर्ष बाटो खोज्नुपर्छ भने एउटै सिजनमा पनि मर्मत गरिरहनुपर्ने हुन्छ । एउटा सिजनको आरोहण सकिएपछि आइसफल डाक्टरहरूले डोरी, भर्‍याङलगायतका सामग्री निकाल्छन् ।  
हिमालमा बाटो बनाउँदा प्रयोग हुने सामाग्रीहरू 

हिमालको यात्रा निकै जोखिमपूर्ण हुन्छ । सानो गल्तीले पनि ज्यानै जान सक्छ भने बाटोमा विभिन्न समस्या पनि आइरहन्छन् । कतै सजिलै पार गर्ने बाटो भेटिने र कतै भर्‍याङ, डोरी तथा पुलहरूको प्रयोग गरेर मात्रै अप्ठ्यारा ठाउँ पार गर्नुपर्ने आरोहीहरू बताउँछन् । हिमालमा बाटो बनाउँदा प्रयोग हुने मुख्य सामग्रीहरु यसप्रकार रहेका छन्–
१. डोरी
आइसफल डाक्टर कामी शेर्पाका अनुसार हिमालमा बाटो बनाउँदा चाहिने सबैभन्दा महत्त्वपूर्ण सामग्री डोरी हो । प्रायः विदेशबाटै ल्याइने उच्च गुणस्तरको डोरी प्रयोग गरेर हिमालमा बाटो बनाइने सगरमाथा प्रदूषण नियन्त्रण समितिले जनाएको छ । 
आवश्यक ठाउँमा डोरी टाँगेपछि आरोहीहरू त्यही डोरी समातेर अघि बढ्छन् । अहिलेसम्मको तथ्याङ्कअनुसार आधार शिविरबाट दोस्रो शिविरसम्म बाटो बनाउँदा पाँच हजार पाँच सय मिटर डोरीको प्रयोग भएको छ ।
२. भर्‍याङ 
प्रायः उकालोमा डोरी टाँगिन्छ भने तेर्सो ठाउँमा भर्‍याङकाे प्रयोग हुन्छ । कतिपय उकालो ठाउँमा, अप्ठ्यारा ठाउँमा पनि भर्‍याङ राखिन्छ । खर्पस तथा हिउँका खाडल तथा टुटेको बाटो पार गर्न भर्‍याङ प्रयोग हुन्छ । पहिलो पटक सगरमाथा आरोहण गर्दा सल्लोका रुखको भर्‍याङ प्रयोग भएको पहिलो आरोही समूहका सदस्य कान्छा शेपा बताउनुहुन्छ । अहिले भने धातुबाट बनाइएका हल्का र बलिया भर्‍याङकाे प्रयोग हुने आइसफल डाक्टरहरू बताउँछन् । भर्‍याङसँगै आवश्यकताअनुसार डोरी पनि टाँगिन्छ । हिमालमा हरेक वर्ष पहिरो जाने तथा हिउँ भासिने क्रम चलिरहने हुँदा आवश्यकताअनुसार भर्‍याङकाे प्रयोग हुन्छ ।
दोस्रो शिविरसम्मको बाटो बनाउँदा सन् २०१८ मा ३२ वटा भर्‍याङ प्रयोग भएकोमा सन् २०१९ मा २० वटा मात्रै प्रयोग भएको एसपीसीसीका महासचिव लामाकाजी शेर्पाले जानकारी दिनुभयो । बाटो कति भत्किएको छ भन्ने अवस्थाअनुसार भर्‍याङकाे सङ्ख्या तल–माथि हुन्छ । भर्‍याङ राख्दा धेरै जोखिम हुने आइसफल डाक्टरहरू बताउँछन् । 
३. आइस स्क्रु र किला
हिमालमा बाटो बनाउँदा अति आवश्यक हुने सामाग्री आइस स्क्रु र हिउँ बाँध्ने किला हुन् । आइस स्क्रु हिउँमा गाड्ने एक प्रकारको सानो आकारको कोदालो हो । यसको सहारामा हिउँमा डोरी टाँगिन्छ । हिउँ बाँध्ने किला डोरी अड्काउन चाहिन्छ । 
४. कपडा 
हिमालको मौसम छिनभरमै परिवर्तन हुन्छ । राम्रो मौसम भएको मिनेटभरमै प्रतिकूल बन्न सक्ने आरोहीहरू बताउँछन् । हिमपात तथा तीव्र हावा चलिरहन्छ । प्रतिकूल मौसम हुँदाहुँदै पनि काम गर्नुपर्ने भएकाले त्यहीअनुसारको कपडा चाहिने आइसफल डाक्टर कामी शेर्पा बताउनुहुन्छ । हिउँमा बाटो बनाउनेहरूका लागि हावा नछिर्ने खालका कपडा, बूट, हेल्मेट, चस्मा, पञ्जा चाहिन्छ ।    
अत्यन्तै जोखिमपूर्ण काम  
हिमालमा बाटो बनाउने काम अत्यन्तै जोखिमपूर्ण हुने आइसफल डाक्टर तथा आरोहीहरू बताउँछन् । पहिरो खस्ने र हिउँ भासिने जस्ता समस्याहरू आइरहने भएकाले बाटो बनाउँदा सबैभन्दा जोखिम खुम्बु आइसफलमा हुने आरोहीहरू बताउँछन् । हिमालमा हिउँका खाल्डाहरू हुने भएकाले विशेषगरी भर्‍याङ थाप्ने क्रममा निकै अप्ठ्यारो हुने गरेको छ । 
रुस–युक्रेन युद्धको प्रभाव  
कोरोना महामारीको प्रभावकै बीच पनि गएको वर्ष अर्थात् सन् २०२१ को वसन्त ऋतुमा सगरमाथा आरोहणका लागि अहिलेसम्मकै धेरै आरोहीले अनुमति लिएका थिए । कोरोनाले नराम्रोसँग प्रभावित भएको पर्यटन क्षेत्रमा पर्वतारोहणले भरथेग गरेको थियो । यो वर्ष पनि आरोहीहरूको सङ्ख्या बढ्ने अनुमान व्यवसायीहरूको थियो । तर रुस–युक्रेन युद्धको प्रभावले अवस्था फरक भएको अन्नपूर्ण एक्स्पिडिसनका कार्यकारी निर्देशक मिङ्मार शेर्पाले बताउनुभयो । रुस र युक्रेनका आरोहीसँगै युरोपका केही आरोहीले समेत बुकिङ रद्ध गरेका उहाँले बताउनुभयो । नेपाल पर्वतारोहण सङ्घकी द्वितीय उपाध्यक्ष माया शेर्पा पनि रुस युक्रेनको युद्ध नेपालको पर्वतारोहण क्षेत्रमा परेको बताउनुहुन्छ । रुसमा पश्चिमा देशले लगाएको नाकाबन्दीको कारण आर्थिक सङ्कट सुरु हुँदा त्यसको मार विश्वभर परेको र यही कारण नेपालको पर्वतारोहण क्षेत्रमा पनि समस्या देखिएको शेर्पाको भनाइ छ । 
अबका तीन महिना आधार शिविरमा रौनक
सगरमाथाको दोस्रो शिविरसम्म बाटो बनाउनका लागि आइसफल डाक्टरहरूको टोलीले पूजापाठ गरेर काम सुरु गरेका छन् । उनीहरूसँगै व्यवसायीहरूले पनि आधार शिविरमा सामान ओसार्ने, पाल टाँग्ने ठाउँ बनाउने लगायतका काम सुरु गरेका छन् । केही समयमै आरोही आधार शिविर पुग्छन् । शरीरलाई उचाइसँग अनुकूल बनाउनका लागि आरोहीहरू आरोहण सुरु गर्नुभन्दा एक महिनाअघि देखि नै आधार शिविरमा पुगेर तालिम तथा तल–माथि हिँड्ने काम गर्छन् । यस्तै भरिया, आरोहण सहयोगी, खाना बनाउने मानिससँग आधार शिविरसम्मको घुमघाममा जाने पदयात्रीहरुको कारण अब झन्डै तीन महिना सगरमाथाको आधार शिविरमा रमझम हुने कीर्तिमानी आरोही मिङ्मार डेभिड शेर्पा बताउनुहुन्छ ।

सङ्क्रमणको जोखिम रहेको तर आधार शिविरमा कोरानासँग मिल्ने लक्षण देखिएका बिरामी भने नरहेका सेभेन समिट ट्रेक कम्पनीका अध्यक्ष मिङ्मा शेर्पा बताउनुहुन्छ । सङ्क्रमणको जोखिम रहेकाले आधार शिविरमा पनि स्वास्थ्य मन्त्रालयले जारी गरेको स्वास्थ्य मापदण्ड कडाइका साथ पालना गरिरहेको पर्यटन विभागकी निर्देशक मीरा आचार्यले बताउनुभयो ।
यस वर्ष पहिलोपटक पर्यटन विभागले पनि दुई जना डाक्टरलाई आधार शिविरमा पठाएको छ । हिमालय रेस्क्यू सङ्घ र पर्यटन विभागको साझेदारीमा आधार शिविरमै स्वास्थ्य शिविर पनि सञ्चालन भइरहेको छ । शिविरमा रहेका डाक्टरले कोरोना सङ्क्रमणको जोखिमलाई ध्यान दिएर आवश्यक सतर्कता अपनाइरहेको निर्देशक आचार्यले बताउनुभयो ।

सगरमाथा क्षेत्रको सरसफाइका लागि फोहरकै सङ्ग्रहालय
",,https://ujyaaloonline.com/story/46152/2020/12/2/garbage-museum-for-sanitation-the-everest-region,,"मंसिर १७, २०७७ बुधबार १७:२:३६","हिमाल जति मनमोहक छ, त्यत्ति नै संवेदनशील पनि छ । हामीले हेर्दा शक्तिशाली खम्बा झैँ ठडिएको हिमालमा थोरै समस्याले पनि विचलन ल्याउन सक्छ । समान्य देखिने समस्याले पनि हिमालमा उथलपुथल ल्याउन सक्छ । पर्वतीय पर्यटन व्यवसाय प्रवर्द्धनसँगै हिमालमा गतिविधिहरू बढेका छन् । व्यवसायका लागि प्रयोग हुँदै आएका हिमालमा हुने स–साना गल्तीले पनि निकै ठूला समस्या आउन सक्छन् । 
हिमालमा आउने समस्या हिमालकाे एक्लाे हाेइन । हिमालमा हुने बदलावले हरेक जीवनलाई जोखिममा पार्न सक्छ । हिमालमा गरिने क्रियाकलापमा ध्यान दिनुपर्ने धेरै कुरामध्ये त्यहाँको सरसफाइ पनि एक हो । धेरै सामान्य सोचिने एउटा प्लास्टिककाे टुक्राले पनि हिमालमा धेरै क्षति गर्न सक्छ भने हिमालमा भएको क्षतिले त्यहाँ आसपास मात्र हैन, हजारौँ किलोमिटर टाढा रहेको समुद्रमा समेत क्षति पुर्‍याउन सक्छ । 

हिमाली क्षेत्रमा सामान्य फोहर पनि हानिकारक
​हुन त फोहर कतै पनि ठिक हैन, जहाँ पनि समस्या ल्याउँछ । तर तुलनात्मक रूपमा फोहरले हिमाली क्षेत्रमा बढी असर गर्छ । झट्ट हेर्दा गर्मी हुने ठाउँमा फोहर चाँडो कुहिएर दुर्गन्ध आउँछ । त्यसैले त्यस्ता ठाउँमा बढी असर पर्छ भन्ने सोचिन्छ । तर त्यसो होइन ।

ढिला गल्ने भएकोले हिमाली क्षेत्रमा फोहरले लामो समयसम्म असर गर्छ । यस्तै हिमाली क्षेत्रकाे वातावरण निकै संवेदनशील हुन्छ । एउटा सामान्य बिरुवा हुर्कनकाे लागि वर्षाैँ लाग्ने हिमाली क्षेत्रमा आउने सामान्य समस्याले पनि त्यहाँको जीवनमा ठूला समस्याहरू ल्याइदिन सक्ने भएकोले हिमाली क्षेत्रमा फोहोर हुनु हानिकारक हुन्छ । 
पर्वतीय पर्यटन व्यवसायका कारण हिउँ भएकै ठाउँहरूमा पनि फोहर थुप्रने क्रम बढिरहेको छ, त्यो झनै हानिकारक हुन्छ । हिउँमा रहने एउटा सामान्य प्लास्टिकले पनि हिउँ पगालिदिन सक्छ । प्लास्टिक, सिसा तथा अरू धातुहरू, हिउँमा छाडिएका त्यस्ता वस्तु तात्दा हिउँ पग्लिन्छ भने कुनै ठाउँ यति संवेदनशील हुन्छन् कि सामान्य रूपमा हिउँ पग्लिएमा पनि त्यसले हिउँ पहिरो जाने लगायतका समस्या ल्याउन सक्छ ।

प्राकृतिक रूपमा भन्दा बढी हिउँ पग्लिन थालेपछि हिमनदीसँगै त्यसको असर समुद्रको तटीय क्षेत्रसम्म पुग्न सक्छ । अर्को कुरा हिमालमा हिउँ घट्दा त्यहाँको प्राकृतिक संरचना खलबलिन गइ अरू धेरै समस्या आउन सक्छन् । त्यसैले हिमाल तथा हिमाली क्षेत्रको सरसफाइ ज्यादै महत्त्वपूर्ण हुन्छ । यही कुरालाई ध्यान दिएर हामीले इको हिमालमार्फत हिमालको सरसफाइ तथा स्वच्छताका कामलाई जोड दिइरहेका छौँ । 

हिमाली क्षेत्रको सरसफाइका चुनौती
एक पटक घुमेर हेर्दा सगरमाथालगायतका हिमाल जति सुन्दर लाग्छन्, त्यहाँको जनजीवन त्यत्ति सहज छैन । मुटुको रगत नै जमाउने किसिमको चिसो, थोरै अक्सिजनमा फेर्नुपर्ने श्वास, दैनिक आवश्यकता पूरा गर्नुपर्दाका चुनौती, कठिन भौगोलिक अवस्थालगायतका कारण त्यहाँको जनजीवन समस्यापूर्ण छ । भलै पछिल्लो समयमा पर्यटन व्यवसायका कारण आम्दानी र सुविधाहरू बढेका छन् तर त्यो व्यवस्था मिलाउन पनि उत्तिकै जोखिम पार गर्नुपर्छ । 

जनजीवन जति असहज छ, त्यहाँको सरसफाइ गर्नु पनि उत्तिकै अप्ठ्यारो हुनु स्वभाविक हो । सडकको पहुँच भएका ठाउँमा विभिन्न वस्तुको पुन प्रयोग हुन सक्छ भने हिमाली क्षेत्रमा पुर्‍याइएका कुनै वस्तुलाई पुन प्रयोगका लागि फिर्ता गर्न मुस्किल पर्छ । चर्को ढुवानी भाडा तथा मानिसले बोकेर अन्यत्र लैजानुपर्ने बाध्यतामा त्यो प्रायः असम्भव हुन्छ । त्यसैले हिमाली क्षेत्रमा सरसफाइका काम चुनौतीपूर्ण हुन्छन् । 
अझ हिमाल आरोहणमै प्रयोग गरेका वस्तु फिर्ता ल्याउन त चर्को सास्ती खेप्नुपर्छ । शरीरलाई ज्यादै भार पर्ने आरोहण साहसिक काम त हो तर शरीर लखतरान हुने भएकोले आरोहणबाट फर्कनेहरूले आफ्ना कारण भएको फोहर फिर्ता गर्न कठिन हुन्छ । त्यस्तो फोहर फिर्ता ल्याउनका लागि त्यहाँ काम गर्न सक्ने दक्ष जनशक्ति चाहिन्छ भने उत्तिकै खर्चिलो पनि हुन्छ ।

यसैले हिमाली क्षेत्रको सरसफाइका लागि सरकारले प्राथामिकताका साथ योजनाहरू कार्यान्वयन गर्नुपर्छ भने स्थानीय बासिन्दा तथा पर्वतीय पर्यटन व्यवसायमा लागेकाहरूले पनि यो विषयलाई गम्भीरताका साथ लिनुपर्छ । 
खुम्बुमा बढ्दो सरसफाइ चेतना
खुम्बु भनेर चिनिने सगरमाथा क्षेत्रका बासिन्दामा सरसफाइप्रतिको चेत बढ्दो छ । अरू हिमाली क्षेत्रको तुलनामा खुम्बु क्षेत्र बढी सफा पनि छ । इको हिमाल, सगरमाथा प्रदूषण नियन्त्रण समितिलगायत अरू विभिन्न सङ्घ–संस्थाले पनि खुम्बुमा फोहरको व्यवस्थापन तथा सरसफाइका लागि लामो समयदेखि काम गरिरहेका छन् । 

सरसफाइका लागि टोलटोलमा चेतनामूलक कार्यक्रमदेखि विद्यालय तथा विभिन्न समूहहरूमा पनि चेतनामूलक कार्यक्रम भइरहेका छन् । यसैको नतिजा त्यहाँका धेरैजसो मानिस बस्ती, बाटो तथा हिमालहरू सफा राख्नुपर्छ भन्छन्, व्यवहारमा पनि त्यो देखिन्छ । तर विभिन्न समस्याका कारण सगरमाथालगायतका हिमालमा फोहर बाँकी नै छ । 
वर्षमा ५० हजारभन्दा धेरै विदेशी पर्यटकसँगै उनीहरुका पथप्रदर्शक, भरियालगायत पुग्ने खुम्बुमा फोहर धेरै उत्पादन हुन्छ । आरोहण हुने हिमालको शिखरकै छेउसम्म पनि फोहरहरू रहेका हुन्छन् । ती फोहर व्यवस्थापन गर्न धेरै कठिन र खर्चिलो हुने भएकोले स्थानीय बासिन्दाको पहुँचमा हुँदैन । त्यसैले ती क्षेत्रको सरसफाइका लागि सङ्घ–संस्था तथा पालिका जुट्नुपर्छ भने सङ्घीय सरकारको कार्यक्रममा पनि यो विषय प्राथामिकतामा हुनुपर्छ । 
खुम्बुमा फोहरको सङ्ग्रहालय

फोहरको सङ्ग्रहालय धेरैका लागि अनौठो विषय हुन सक्छ । तर हामीले खुम्बुमा फोहरको सङ्ग्रहालय सञ्चालन गर्दैछौँ । नाम्चेभन्दा केही माथि रहेको स्याङ्बोचेमा निर्माण भइरहेको सङ्ग्रहालयमा सगरमाथा क्षेत्रमा उत्पादन हुने फोहरबाट विभिन्न कलाकृतिहरू बनाएर प्रदर्शनका लागि राखिन्छ । 
पर्यटन व्यवसायका कारण सगरमाथालगायतका हिमाली क्षेत्रमा विभिन्न धातु, प्लास्टिकलगायतका वस्तु पुग्छन् र ती फोहरको रुपमा त्यही रहन्छन् । तिनै वस्तुलाई सङ्कलन गरेर विभिन्न आकृति बनाइ सङ्ग्रहालयमा राख्ने तथा बिक्रीसमेत गर्ने लक्ष्य रहेको छ । यसबाट थोरै मात्रामा भए पनि हिमाली क्षेत्रको फोहर व्यवस्थापन हुन्छ भने यसैको माध्यमबाट हाम्रो पर्यटन व्यवसायको प्रवर्द्धन पनि हुन्छ । यसको तयारी अन्तिम चरणमा पुगेको छ । 

आगामी वसन्त ऋतुसम्ममा सञ्चालनमा ल्याउन लागिएको सङ्ग्रहालयमा राखिने कलाकृति बनाउनका लागि विश्वभरका नामी कलाकारहरू इच्छुक देखिएका छन् । उनीहरु त्यही हिमाल छेउमा पुगेर आफ्नो कला–कर्म गर्नेछन् । यसबाट फोहरको व्यवस्थापनसँगै देशकै प्रचार–प्रसारसमेत हुन्छ भने हिमाली क्षेत्रको सरसफाइका लागि सरोकारवालाई झकझकाउँछ भन्ने लागेको छ । 'सगरमाथा नेक्स्ट' नाम रहेको सङ्ग्रहालय सफल भएमा यसैको सिको अरू हिमालमा पनि गरिने छ । 
हिमाल हाम्रा सम्पत्ति हुन्, यसबाट नेपाल विश्वमा चिनिएको छ । यिनै हिमालका कारण बर्सेनि लाखौँ पर्यटक नेपाल आउँछन् । हाम्रो पर्यटन व्यवसायको ठूलो हिस्सा पर्वतीय पर्यटनमा आधारित छ । यसको कारण हाम्रा हिमाल नै हुन् ।
यी हिमाल नरहेमा हाम्रो पर्यटन व्यवसाय त समस्यामा पर्छ नै सँगै समग्र जीवन नै सङ्कटमा पर्न सक्छ । त्यसै पनि जलवायु परिवर्तनका कारण समस्यामा पर्दै गएको हिमाली क्षेत्र फोहरका कारण अझ धेरै समस्यामा पर्दैछ । त्यसैले हिमाली क्षेत्रका फोहरको सही व्यवस्थापन गरी हिमाली क्षेत्रलाई स्वच्छ राख्नको लागि हामी सबै जुट्नुपर्छ ।

सगरमाथा सफाइ: साेचे अनुरुप काम भएन, वर्षाैँदेखिकाे फाेहर जस्ताकाे तस्तै
",,https://ujyaaloonline.com/story/24462/2019/8/9/mount-everest-clean-up-campaign,,"साउन २४, २०७६ शुक्रबार ८:१०:४८","यो वर्ष सगरमाथाको दुईवटा विषय अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय चर्चामा रहे । एउटा ट्राफिक जाम, अर्को फोहोर । ट्राफिक जाम हुनुमा धेरै आरोहीलाई अनुमति दिनु र सम्पर्क अधिकृतको कमजोर भूमिका थियो । फोहोर भने वर्षौंदेखि नै थुप्रिँदै आएको छ । 

एक आरोही भन्छन्, ‘तेञ्जिङ नोर्गे शेर्पा र एडमण्ड हिलारी पहिलोपटक शिखरमा पुग्दादेखिको फोहोर सगरमाथामा बाँकी नै छ ।’ यो कुरामा सगरमाथाको पहिलो सफल आरोहण दलमा सहभागी कान्छा शेर्पा पनि सहमत हुनुहुन्छ । उहाँ भन्नुहुन्छ, ‘हामीले लगेका मट्टीतेलका जर्किन, स्टोभ, अक्सिजनका सिलिण्डर, टेन्ट लगायतका सामग्रीमाथिल्ला शिविरहरुमा छाडिएका थिए, ती फोहोरका रुपमा अझै पनि होलान् । ’
यसरी हेर्दा सगरमाथामा कम्तीमा पनि ६६ वर्षभन्दा पुराना फोहोर समेत रहेका छन् । पछिल्लो समय सगरमाथामा सरसफाइ अभियान पनि चलिरहेका छन् । सगरमाथा प्रदूषण नियन्त्रण समिति (एसपीसीसी) ले आधार शिविरभन्दा तल बर्सेनि सफाइ गर्दै आएको छ भने सन् २०११ पनि संस्थागत रुपमा पनि विभिन्न रुपमा सगरमाथा सफाइ अभियान चलेका छन् । 

यो वर्ष भने सरकारकै अगुवाइमा सगरमाथा सफाइ अभियान सञ्चालन गरियो । सफाइ अभियानबाट चारवटा पुराना शवसहित ११ टन फोहोर संकलन गरेर व्यवस्थापन गरिएको पर्यटन विभागले दावी गरेको छ । तर आरोहीहरु भने सगरमाथा सफाइका लागि अझै धेरै पहल गर्नुपर्ने बताउँछन् । २४ पटक सगरमाथाको शिखर चुमेर कीर्तिमानी कायम गरेलगत्तै काठमाण्डौ आउने क्रममा आरोही कामीरिता शेर्पाले विमानस्थलमै सरसफाइ अभियान सन्तोषजनक नभएको भन्दै आक्रोश व्यक्त गर्नुभयो ।
सफाइ अभियानको नाममा करोडौँ खर्च भए पनि उपलब्धि कम भएको शेर्पाको भनाइ थियो । उहाँजस्तै सगरमाथाको आरोहण गरेर फर्किएका अरु आरोहीहरुले पनि सगरमाथाको आधार शिविरभन्दा माथिको सफाइ सन्तोषजनक नरहेको बताएका छन् । 
अहिले हरेक आरोही फर्कँदा आधार शिविरभन्दा माथिबाट कम्तिमा आठ किलो फोहोर फिर्ता ल्याउनुपर्ने प्रावधान भए पनि यसकाे कार्यान्वयन पक्ष कमजोर छ । सफाइ अभियान पनि आरोहणको मुख्य मौसममा सञ्चालन गर्दा प्रभावकारी नभएको हिमालमा काम गर्ने अनुभवीहरु बताउँछन् । 

हिमालमा निकै जोखिम हुन्छ । त्यहाँ फोहोर संकलन गर्नु र व्यवस्थापन गर्नु चुनौतीपूर्ण हुन्छ । त्यसैले त्यहाँ सरसफाइ अभियान सञ्चालन गर्दा समय र जनशक्तिलाई विशेष ख्याल गर्नुपर्छ । 
मार्च महिना उपयुक्त
सगरमाथामा अहिले फोहोरको बढी समस्या रहेको आधार शिविरभन्दा माथि हो । आधार शिविरभन्दा तल एसपीसीसीले नियमित सफाइ गरिरहेको छ भने अरु अभियानमा पनि त्यहाँको फोहोर संकलन र व्यवस्थापन तुलनात्मक रुपमा सहज छ । आधार शिविरभन्दा माथि धेरैजसो समय हिउँ रहने हुँदा हिउँले फोहोर छोपिएको हुन्छ । त्यसैले हिउँ कम भएको मौसममा जानुपर्छ ।
बितेको दुई दशकदेखि सगरमाथा क्षेत्रमा उद्धारको काम गर्दै आएका लाक्पा नोर्बु शेर्पा भन्नुहुन्छ ‘सबै हिसाबबाट मार्च महिनामा सगरमाथा सफाइ गर्नु उचित हुन्छ ।’

मार्च महिना सफाइका लागि उपयुक्त हुनुमा हिमाली उद्धारकर्मी शेर्पाले दिनुभएका आधारहरु यसप्रकार छन् ः–
हिउँ कम हुनु
सगरमाथाको आधार शिविरभन्दा माथि धेरै फोहोर छ । अझ धेरै फोहोर चौथो शिविरमा छ । आधार शिविरभन्दा माथि धेरैजसो समय बाक्लो हिउँ हुन्छ । हिउँले फोहोर छोपेको हुन्छ भने त्यहाँ जान पनि सकिंदैन । मार्च महिनामा हिउँ कम हुने, बाटो खुलाउन सकिने भएकोले मार्च महिना उपयुक्त हुन्छ ।
टेन्ट टाँगिनु
अप्रिल महिनाको शुरुवातदेखि नै आधार शिविरमा टेन्ट टाँग्ने काम शुरु हुन्छ । आरोही तथा सहयोगीहरुले टेन्ट टाँग्दा फोहोर छोपिन्छ । टेन्ट निकाल्ने बेलामा सफाइको काम गर्न सक्ने मौसम नै सकिएको हुन्छ । त्यसैले आरोहणकार्यका लागि टेन्ट टाँग्नुभन्दा अगाडि नै सफाइको काम सकाउँदा पुरानो फोहोर संकलन गर्न सकिन्छ । यसको लागि मार्च उपयुक्त महिना हो ।  
जनशक्तिको उपलब्धता
यस वर्षको सफाइ अभियान वैशाख १ गतेदेखि शुरु भयो । त्यत्तिबेला सबैजसो शेर्पाहरु हिमाल आरोहण टोलीलाई लिएर सगरमाथा लगायत विभिन्न हिमालमा गईसकेका थिए । चैतको मध्यबाट नै आरोहीहरु आधार शिविरतर्फ जाने हुँदा उनीहरुलाई लिएर शेर्पाहरु पनि आधार शिविरतर्फ लागिसक्छन् । त्यसैले यसपटकको सफाइ अभियानमा दक्ष जनशक्ति पाउन सकिएन । 

उदारकर्मी लाक्पा नोर्बु शेर्पा भन्नुहुन्छ, ‘हिमालका काम गर्ने भन्दा बाहेकको मानिस आधार शिवरमा पुगेर फोहोर संकलन गर्नै सक्दैन भने आधार शिविरभन्दा माथि उक्लने कुरै भएन, आरोहण समयमा बलिया, आरोहणको सीप र क्षमता भएका शेर्पाहरु सबै आरोहीहरुसँग हुन्छन्, त्यसैले आरोहण कार्यमा काम गर्न नसक्नेलाई सफाइ अभियानमा लगाएपछि आधार शिविरभन्दा माथिको फोहोर संकलन हुने कुरै भएन, त्यसैले आधार शिविरभन्दा माथिका शिविरमा थुप्रै हिउँ छ ।’
निजी क्षेत्रलाई जिम्मा दिनुपर्ने
यस पटक सञ्चालन भएको सफाइ अभियानमा धेरै राजनीतिक प्रभाव परेको सगरमाथा क्षेत्रमा काम गर्नेहरुले गुनासो गरेका छन् । अभियानका नाममा समारोह गर्दा, अनुगमनका नाममा विभिन्न नेता तथा कर्मचारीहरुको आधार शिविर भ्रमण गर्दा धेरै खर्च भएको उनीहरुले बताएका छन् । यस्तै आधार शिविरमा बस्ने कर्मचारीहरुको आकर्षक भत्ताका कारण त्यहाँका लागि कर्मचारी तोकिँदा पनि प्रभाव परेको छ ।
यस्ता धेरै कारणले गर्दा उपलब्धी कम भएको भन्दै जानकारहरुले निजी संस्था वा कम्पनीलाई निश्चित रकम तोकेर तोकिएको फोहोर संकलन गरिसक्नुपर्ने सम्झौतासहित जिम्मेवारी दिँदा उपयुक्त हुने शेर्पाको सुझाव छ । 

एक जना आरोहीले भने, ‘सफाइ अभियानका नाममा नेता र हाकिमहरु हेलिकप्टर चढेर हिमाल घुम्ने तथा आधार शिविर ओर्लेर फोटो खिच्ने क्रम धेरै बाक्लियो, आधार शिविरमा सफाइ गर्ने शेर्पा भन्दा हेर्ने कर्मचारी धेरै भए । यिनै कारणले गर्दा सगरमाथामा चर्चा भएको जस्तो सफाइ भएको छैन’, यी विभिन्न कारणले गर्दा तोकिएको सफाइका लागि तोकिएको खर्चमा काम सम्पन्न गर्नेगरी सम्झौता भए उपलब्धि बढी हुने जानकारहरु बताउँछन् । 
आधार शिविरभन्दा माथि केन्द्रित हुनुपर्ने  
आधार शिविरभन्दा तल एसपीसीसीले जसरी काम गरिरहेको छ त्यो नै अहिलेका लागि पर्याप्त छ । आधार शिविरमा नगण्य मात्रामा मात्रै फोहोर रहेको उदारकर्मी शेर्पा पनि बताउनुहुन्छ । समस्या त्यसभन्दा माथि हो । पुराना शवदेखि लिएर अरु फोहोर तेस्रो चौथो शिविरमा बढी थुप्रिएका छन् ।
हिउँ बाक्लिँदा पुरिने फोहोर हिउँ पग्लिएसँगै सतहमा देखिन्छ । आरोहण मौसममा पनि टेन्ट बनाउँदा थिचिएको हुन्छ । त्यसैले उपयुक्त समय र दक्ष जनशक्तिलाई प्रयोग गरेर सगरमाथाको फोहोर हटाउन आराहण कार्यमा संलग्नहरु बताउँछन् । 

केही आरोही बिरामी पर्छन् । आरोहण गरेर फर्कँदा शरीरमा शक्ति सकिएको हुन्छ । यस्ता कारण मापदण्ड अनुसार आरोहीले फर्कँदा आठ किलो फोहोर फिर्ता गर्नुपर्ने बाध्यता पनि कार्यान्वयन भएको छैन । त्यसैले यो व्यवस्थाको प्रभावकारी अनुगमन गरेर फोहोर फिर्ता नगर्नेको फोहोर वापतको धरौटी फिर्ता नगरेर त्यही हिमाल सफाइका लागि प्रयोग गरेमा पनि सहज हुने व्यवसायीहरु बताउँछन् । 
विश्वको सानको रुपमा रहेको सगरमाथामा फोहोर बढ्दा अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय स्तरमा नराम्रो सन्देश गएको छ भने फोहोरका कारण हिउँ पग्लिने लगायतका समस्या देखिने वातावारणको क्षेत्रमा काम गर्ने जानकारहरु बताउँछन् । त्यसैले हिउँ र इज्जत दुबै बचाउन सगरमाथा लगायतका हिमालहरु सफा गर्नु जरुरी छ ।",,https://ujyaaloonline.com,,1.0,0.0,0.3,0.9,"Governance, Other",Sacred Himalayan Landscape,Other,Nepali

काठमाण्डौमा वायु प्रदूषण अहिलेसम्मकै उच्च, सकभर घरबाहिर ननिस्कन सरकारको आग्रह

काठमाण्डौ उपत्यकामा यसअघि वायुको गुणस्तर एअर क्वालिटी इण्डेक्स (एक्वुआई) अधिकतम दुई सय नजिक पुगेकोमा साेमबार (हिजो) तीन सय नाघेको उहाँले बताउनुभयो ।
विश्व स्वास्थ्य सङ्गठन (डब्ल्यूएचओ) ले स्वास्थ्यका लागि एक्वुआई २५ हुनुपर्ने बताएको छ भने ५० सम्म हुनुलाई राम्रो मानिन्छ । एक्वुआई १ सय ५० सम्म पुग्दा संवेदनशील र २ सय सम्म पुगे सबैका लागि अस्वस्थ मानिन्छ । एक्वुआई ३ सय पुग्नु सबैका लागि घातक रहेको जोशीले बताउनुभयो ।
चिसो, घाम तथा हावा नलागेको कारण वायुमण्डलमा भएका धुलो तथा धुवाँका कणहरू सतहको नजिक थिग्रिएकाले पनि प्रदूषण बढेको वातावरण विभागले जनाएको छ ।
प्रदूषणका कारण आँखा पोल्ने, रुघा लाग्ने, खोकी लाग्ने, छाला चिलाउनेलगायतका लक्षण अल्पकालीन रूपमा देखिएका छन् भने मुटु, फोक्सो तथा मस्तिष्कमा हुने खराब असर दीर्घकालमा देखिन सक्ने जनस्वास्थ्यविद् बताउँछन् । एअर क्वालिटी इण्डेक्स ३ सय भन्दामाथि पुगेमा सरकारले आपत्कालीन अवस्था घोषणा गर्न सक्छ ।

स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम : बाँकेका किसान फेरि कृषिमै फर्किए
",,https://ujyaaloonline.com/story/66548/2022/3/16/Banke-farmer-return-to-farming,,"चैत २, २०७८ बुधबार १४:०:३","बाँके – कृषि पेसाबाट पलायन भएका किसानहरू स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम लागू भएपछि फेरि कृषिमा फर्किएका छन् । बाँकेको राप्ती सोनारी गाउँपालिका ७ फत्तेपुरका किसानहरू पुरानो प्रविधिबाट खेती गर्दा उत्पादनमा कमी भएपछि मजदुरी पेसामा लागेका थिए । तर कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्र बाँकेले ७ नम्बर वडामा स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम लागू गरेपछि किसानहरू फेरि कृषि पेसामा फर्किएका हुन् ।

याे गाउँपालिका कृषि पेसामा होमिएको ठाउँ हो । तर पुरानै विधि र प्रविधि अपनाएर कृषि गर्दा उत्पादनमा कमी आएको थियो । लगानी र मेहनत धेरै लाग्ने तर उत्पादन कम भएका कारणले किसानहरू कृषि पेसाबाट पलायन भइ दैनिक ज्यालादारी मजदुरी काममा लागेका थिए । नेपाल सरकारले २०७५ सालदेखि बाँके जिल्लामा कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्रमार्फत स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम सञ्चालन गरेपछि किसानहरू उत्पादन देखेर फेरि कृषि पेसामा फर्किएका हुन् । 
कृषि उत्पादनका लागि कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्रले हरेक सिजनमा र हरेक बर्खामा किसानहरूलाई ५० प्रतिशत अनुदानमा कृषि सामग्री दिने र प्याकेट क्षेत्रका लागि मल, बिउ पूर्णरूपमा ज्ञान केन्द्रले दिएपछि थप हौसला आएको राप्ती सोनारी गाँउपालिका ७ फत्तेपुरका किसान चक्रबहादुर थारुले बताउनुभयो । 

बर्खामा धान, हिउँदेमा आलु मात्रै उत्पादन गरिरहेका किसानहरू २०७५ सालदेखि सबै महिना खेती गरिरहेका छन् । स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम लागू भएपछि अहिले फत्तेपुरका एक सय सात घरले सिजनअनुसार खेती गरिरहेका छन् । बर्खामा धान, हिउँदेमा आलु र तोरीका साथै वसन्तमा मकै खेती गरिरहेका छन् । तर नेपाल सरकारबाट स्वीकृत भएका मकै भारतीय मकैजस्तो उत्पादन नभएपछि उनीहरू भारतीय मकैको बिउमा निर्भर परेको फत्तेपुर स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँका किसान तथा सचिव खोज लालथारुले बताउनुभयो ।
तराईको भेग र बाँकेको माटो उर्बर भएका कारणले मकै उत्पादन निकै राम्रो भैरहेको छ । स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम लागू भएदेखि नै फत्तेपुरका किसानहरू पूर्णरूपमा कृषिमा आबद्ध भएको कृषि ज्ञान केन्द्रका अधिकृत दिनेश भट्टराईले बताउनुभयो । यस क्षेत्रमा उत्पादन हुने चाँद, ताला ११ जिरो सात, जेपी पाँच सय दुई जातका मकै अहिले वसन्त सिजनमा नाै बिघा जमिनमा मकै खेती गरिएको अधिकृत भट्टराईले जानकारी दिनुभयाे । 

राप्ती सोनारी गाउँपालिकाले स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँका किसानहरूलाई आर्थिक सहयोग नगरे पनि प्राविधिक रूपमा किसानहरूले खबर गर्नासाथ सहयोग गर्दै आएको गाउँपालिकाकी कृषि प्राविधिक सुमित्रकुमारी थारुले बताउनुभयो । नेपाल सरकारले मान्यता दिएको मकै धेरै समय लाग्ने, घोघा लामो भए पनि कम दाना लाग्ने, धेरै अग्लो हुने र उत्पादनमा कमी आएका कारण किसानहरूले भारतीय मकैको बिउ लगाउने गरेको उहाँले सुनाउनुभयाे । 
वडास्तरमै स्मार्ट कृषि गाउँ कार्यक्रम लागू भएपछि विदेश पलायन हुन लागेका युवाहरूलाई स्वदेशमै रोजगारीको अवसर दिइ आत्मनिर्भर बनाउन र कृषि उत्पादनमा बढ्ने देखिन्छ ।",,https://ujyaaloonline.com,,1.0,0.0,0.7,0.4,"Governance, Other",Other,Other,Nepali

Introduction
The amount of carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation is a key component of the global carbon cycle [1]. Variation in carbon flux has been well understood in the terrestrial ecosystem [2] and forests have been absorbing twice as much carbon as they emitted [3]. For example, from 2001 to 2019, global forests emitted 8.25 GtCOe yr-1 and removed 15.6 GtCOe yr-1 [4]. Globally, there is an important positive to weak relationship between carbon density and biodiversity [57]. Conservation of the forest ecosystem is critical for maintaining both the biodiversity richness and carbon density including sequestering the atmospheric carbon [8].
Large mammals play a key role in shaping and maintaining natural processes [9, 10]; ecoregions that retain intact large mammalian faunas also sequester large amounts of carbon [11]. Elimination of large vertebrates may adversely affect ecosystem dynamics [10] and ultimately reduce carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services [12]. Tiger (Panthera tigris) has been identified as one of the large mammals and top predators in the trophic structures whose density and abundance affects the ecosystem and supports ecosystem services [13]. Protection of carbon-rich ecosystems such as forest ecosystems within the tiger conservation landscapes [14], can directly or indirectly benefit overall diversity including wildlife [15, 16]. Wikramanayake et al. [17] classified carbon rich ecosystems into pioneer sal forests, mixed forests, riparian forests, alluvial floodplain, and grasslands distributed along the lowland plains (Tarai) and churia (Siwalikh, also called as chure) physiographic range as potential habitats for tigers. Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) is a pioneer transboundary tiger conservation landscape spatially distributed between Nepal and India. Managing the tiger habitat is highly pressing in the premises of doubling the wild tigers in its ranging states and Nepal is the first country in the world to double its tiger populations in wild by 2022 [18]. Thus, there is a dire need for conservation that integrates and brings in the synergies between conservation of tiger, its habitat and carbon it contains measured in-terms of above-ground biomass carbon stock (hereafter referred to as AGBCS).
It has been shown that carbon density in tiger conservation forest landscapes is 3.5 times greater than in forests occurring outside tiger landscapes [12, 19]. Gurung et al. [20] estimated a 252,000 ± 22,000 Gg C stock contain within the potential tiger habitat that hoards high tiger densities (~15 tigers per 100 km2) within the five protected areas and landscape occupancy probabilities (~0.68) [21] in TAL-Nepal. There remains a knowledge gap on empirical relationship between tiger and carbon it contains within its potential habitat in the landscape and elsewhere for bringing synergies between goal of conserving tiger and securing ecosystem services. In this connection, this research focused on exploring the relationship between healthy tiger population-in terms of population densities [22] and occupancy probabilities [23]- and AGBCS in its potential tiger habitat.
We reviewed the readily available datasets to assess the relationship between Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture (SECR) tiger density and occupancy probabilities with AGBCS. Reduction in grassland patch along with increase in forest patch in Chitwan National Park (CNP) may negatively affect the abundance of the prey species, resulting in limiting tiger population density [24]. Restoring the habitat heterogeneity is the best approach for managing habitat, benefiting the tiger and its prey [24]. We hypothesized that tiger density and occupancy probabilities (Psi, , 01) would follow a negative relationship with AGBCS mediated by habitat classes identified along the potential tiger habitat in the landscape. In this paper, we assessed: the relationship between tiger density and occupancy probabilities and AGBCS; and AGBCS status in eight habitat types identified in the landscape and conservation units (protected areas, corridors, and large forest connectivity blocks) defined for tiger conservation.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
The study was conducted based on output result data sets from National Tiger survey conducted in 2013 and above-ground carbon stock estimation survey conducted in Nepal side of TAL. Dataset used for the analysis can be reused with due permission and acknowledgement from Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation and WWF Nepal. Animal care and use committee approval was not required as it was based on the secondary data that used non-invasive techniques such camera trapping and sign surveys.
Study areas and sites
For assessing relationship between AGBCS and tiger density at the protected area level, one of the five tiger bearing protected areas was selected from TALCNP (27.16 N83.50 E to 27.42 N 84.46 E, 953 km2, the oldest national park of Nepal, Fig 1). CNP was selected firstly due to availability of data on AGBCS and posterior tiger density estimates [25]; and secondly, least variation in tiger density estimates in CNP among other tiger bearing protected areas in the landscape. CNP is in the south-central region of Nepal and in the eastern section of the TAL. The national park has a monsoonal humid climate with more than 85% of the annual precipitation (2,180 mm) occurring between July and October. The dry season occurs for 8 months between November and June. The vegetation can best be described as a subtropical, dry, and deciduous forest with colonizing Saccharum spontaneum and Imperata cylindrica on the dry riverbeds and the floodplains to a climax Sal (Shorea robusta) forest on bhabar and hillsides [26]. The national park supports a diverse mammalian fauna including carnivores such as tiger, leopard (Panthera pardus fusca), and dhole (Cuon alpinus). Tiger density (no. of individuals per 100 km2) in CNP is estimated at 3.84 (SD 0.34) in 2013, 3.81 (SD 0.25) in 2018, and 4.06 (SD 0.22) in 2022 respectively, while tiger density in rest of the four tiger bearing protected areas (Parsa, Banke, Bardia and Shuklaphanta National Parks) ranged between 0.977.15 tigers per 100 km2 [18] in 2022.

To address our objectives, Nepal side of TAL (28.45 N80.04 E to 27.03 N 85.25 E, Fig 1) was focused that stretches across 700 km along the flat plain between the Bagmati River in the east to the Shuklaphanta National Park in the west (Fig 1). Entire TAL is extended till Yamuna River in India covering total area of 50,911 km2 (Nepal: 24,710 km2, India: 26,201 km2). Five protected areas (Parsa, Chitwan, Banke, Bardia, and Shuklaphanta National Parks) are located within the Nepal side of TAL with varying degrees of forest connectedness identified as corridors (seven in total: Shikaribas, Barandabhar, Kamdi, Khata, Karnali, Mohana-Laljhadi, and Bramhadev). Corridors were identified based on ground surveys and tiger dispersal model (developed through GIS-based least cost pathway model) developed from last 30 years of field research on tigers [17]. These seven corridors were priority for ecological restoration. Krishnasar Conservation Area is also located in TAL with a focus on Blackbuck conservation and connected to Bardia National Park through Babai River and riverine forests patches in between. Entire TAL is part of the Terai Duar and Savannah Grasslands ecoregion [27] and contains the remaining 75% of forests of the Tarai plains and the Siwalik hills.
Supervised habitat classification in Terai Arc Landscape
We used remotely sensed supervised classification data [28] for mapping AGBCS at the landscape level as they have been widely used in studies to link AGBCS measurements from the field to satellite observations [29]. We used freely available Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) cloud-free mosaic image from the United States Geological Services (USGS)s Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) for the year 2001 image having Row Path 14141, 14241, 14341, and 14440. Shrestha [28] used 75 ground-truthing points for the habitat classification and classified images into 8 habitat classes for classifying all land cover designations and includes: dry sal forest, high density mixed forest, high density sal forest, low density mixed forest, low density sal forest, degraded scrubland, grassland, and riverine forest (See S1 Fig). Sampling frequency of ground truthing points along each habitat class were dry sal forest (19%), high density mixed forest (13%), high density sal forest (12%), low density mixed forest (12%), low density sal forest (12%), degraded scrubland (8%), grassland (11%), and riverine forest (13%). Details on supervised classification analysis can be found elsewhere [17, 28]. Habitat classification was conducted in ERDAS Imagine (Ver.16, Hexagon Geospatial, Atlanta, Georgia) for image processing and classification, while post-classification and a change analysis was done in ArcGIS (Ver 10.2). From the same Landsat 7 ETM+ data sets for our habitat classification analysis, confusion matrix was prepared where overall producers classification accuracy to be ~ 82.2% and kappa coefficient to be ~ 0.80.
AGBCS estimation along the habitat classes
We used the simplest approach [29, 30] to derive AGBCS maps by assigning a single value to each of the habitat classes that have been derived from satellite data (Landsat 7 ETM+) and placed into eight habitat categories. AGBCS was mapped by assigning carbon values for above-ground biomass to each habitat classes (identified as i). This is similar approach done for carbon mapping in Sumatra tiger habitat in Indonesia [13]. The carbon stock for each habitat class is equal to the above-ground densities for habitat class as represented in Fig 1. The total carbon storage is equal to the sum of carbon density for each habitat class multiplied by the area for respective habitat class i with n as the number of habitat classes (identified in middle figure in Fig 1). Carbon stocks estimation in TAL was based on the forest inventory method [20]. Published AGBCS datasets were taken from 97 sampling plot (circular plot measuring 500m2) spread across the landscape [20, 31]. Of the total 97 AGBCS sampling plots (aka sample size), 53 plots were located across the five national parks (Parsa National Park (n = 7), CNP (n = 20), Banke National Park (n = 14), Bardia National Park (n = 8), and Shuklaphanta National Park (n = 4)), respectively, while rest of the 44 plots were located in identified corridors and large forest connectivity blocks outside the protected areas. Spatial distribution of sampling points along the habitat classes includes degraded scrub (n = 9), dry sal forest (n = 29), high density mixed forest (n = 7), high density sal forest (n = 17), low density mixed forest (n = 15), low density sal forest (n = 14), grassland (n = 5), and riverine forest (n = 1). Only one sampling plot was located in the riverine forest habitat, so published carbon stock representing riverine forest habitat was used-estimated at 80.47 tC/ha [32]-for the analysis.
Comparing tiger density and AGBCS
We used 2013 published results from camera trap survey conducted in CNP. Camera trap tiger data were collected from 365 camera trap grids-each grid cell measuring 2 km by 2 km-spread across 1,460 km2 of tiger habitat (grassland and forest) in CNP. Survey was conducted in winter season (Feb-May) in 2013 with total sampling effort of 10,860 camera trap days [33]. At each grid cell, a pair of cameras were deployed at a strategic locations such as animal trails, forest road, river banks, and human trails etc. for total of 15 days. All the photos from the survey were collected and individual tigers were identified based on strip patterns. Detection history of the individual tigers were made. SECR models [34, 35] were run for the tiger population density estimation. Survey estimated population size of 120 tigers in CNP [33]. For comparing the relationship between tiger density and AGBCS, CNP plot-wise (0.33 km2) converged posterior tiger density estimates (no of tigers per 0.33 km2) [33] was used. Tiger density estimation in Dhakal et. al. [33] was carried out using the Bayesian-Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture (B-SCR) approach [36] implemented in SPACECAP [37]. A grid of home range centers with equally spaced points (with habitat activity centers ~ 9,240 points), each 0.33 km2 measuring 4,374 km2 was used for tiger density estimation in SPACECAP. The habitat extent of 10 km roughly representing Chitwan valley and part of the Valmiki Tiger Reserve were used, which are historically known to have tiger habitat [38]. After removing the 2,330 km2 area of settlements (villages and agriculture areas) and other areas with no carbon data (such as river banks, water bodies, and clouded portion), habitat mask was finalized at 2,044 km2 (~6,858 activity centers) for further analysis. Three standard input data files (animal capture dates and locations, trap deployment dates and locations, and hypothetical activity centers) were used. Dhakal et. al. [33] analysis used the half normal detection function and included a behavioral response in the detection process and performed 65,000 iterations, of which the initial 15,000 were discarded as the burn-in, thinning rate was set at 1, and augmentation value of 350 individuals (over three times the expected number of ~120 animals) for CNP. Geweke diagnostic statistics with |Z| &lt; 1.6 score was used to check model convergence [37]. Using the B-SCR, overall tiger density (no of tiger per 100 km2) in CNP estimated to be 3.84 (SE 0.34) with estimate sigma () value equals to 4.1 km. This sigma value infers to tiger activity centers concentrated within 4.1 km from its captured location. Converged posterior tiger density estimates for each habitat pixel taken from the output file of the SPACECAP analysis was used for developing the spatial tiger density surface in ArcGIS 10.2. The spatial location of each habitat pixel, containing posterior tiger density estimates, was overlaid with layer of habitat classes. Carbon stock was computed as the summation of carbon stock of all habitat classes available divided by the total area of habitat classes combined in each pixel.
Comparing occupancy probabilities and AGBCS
We used tiger occupancy probabilities [23] estimates and compared with total AGBCS for assessing the relationship between metrics at the landscape level. Occupancy survey was carried out across the potential tiger habitat (forest and grassland, measuring 13,915 km2) spatially divided into 96 grid cells (each grid cell measuring 15 km by 15 km (~225 km2)). We surveyed high probability sites (e.g. trails, ridgelines, roads, and river and stream beds) for tiger signs (scrape, scratch, scats, pugmark, kills, and urine) detection within each grid cell [39].
The survey was completed during the cool-dry period from December 2008 to February 2009 to ensure seasonal consistency across sites with sampling effort of 2016.5 km of walk along the search path. Tiger occupancy data was analyzed in the program PRESENCE [40] for estimating site specific tiger occupancy and detection probabilities. Published site-specific tiger occupancy probabilities [41] (range: min = 0.01 to max = 1.00; mean = 0.366) estimated for 96 grid cells in the landscape was used for the analysis. AGBCS was assigned to each habitat classes available within each grid cell. Carbon stock was computed as the summation of carbon stock of all habitat classes available divided by the total area of habitat classes combined in each grid cell.
AGBCS in conservation units
Gurung et al. [20] did not segregate the carbon stock based on conservation unit wise- protected areas, corridors, and large forest connectivity blocks. We segregated habitat classes and computed total AGBCS at protected area, corridors, and large forest connectivity blocks level respectively. Spatial layers of five-tiger bearing protected areas, corridors, large forest connectivity blocks, and landscape boundaries were overlaid onto the layer of spatial distribution map containing eight habitat classes datasets (see S1 Fig) in ArcGIS (Ver10.2). The total carbon stock for each conservation unit is equal to sum of its carbon density multiplied by the total area of the conservation unit.
Pearson correlation [42] was used for measuring the relationship between mean tiger density and total AGBCS, while between grid-specific tiger occupancy probabilities and total AGBCS. Mean, cross tabulation, and correlation tests were conducted using IBM SPSS (Ver 22.0) for Windows.
Results
AGBCS at sampling plot
We found variation in AGBCS along the mosaic habitat sampling plots (Fig 2) spread across 8-habitat class with high AGBCS recorded in high density mixed forest (~223 tC/ha) and low in degraded scrubland (~73.2 tC/ha). Among the sampling plot in national parks (n = 53), tiger density ranged between 0.003 tigers per km2 in degraded scrubland and 0.06 tigers per km2 in the riverine forest (Fig 2). We found high variation in negative correlation (r = -0.00 to -0.38) between the total AGBCS and tiger density across the sampling plot (Fig 3).

AGBCS within Chitwan National Park
In CNP, AGBCS ranged between ~297 tC/ha in high-density sal forest and~46 tC/ha in tall grassland with an average of ~160 tC/ha. All the forests (~1,930 km2) and grasslands (114 km2) which are potential tiger habitats contains ~ 30.19 million tC. We found a significant negative correlation (n = 6,858, r = -0.20, p &lt; 0.01) between tiger density and AGBCS in CNP and surrounding areas. We found highest tiger density ~ 0.06 individuals per 0.33 km2 in the riverine forest and lowest estimates (~0.00) in degraded scrubland, respectively. At the fine pixel level, overall mean tiger density of 0.0135 tigers per 0.33 km2 is equivalent to mean total of 43.7 tC/ha (range: 149.20.003 tC/ha) in CNP (Fig 4).

AGBCS in the protected areas, corridors, large forest connectivity, and landscape
Grid wise AGBCS ranged between a minimum of 72.9 tC/ha (within the corridors) to the maximum of 128.7 tC/ha (within protected areas) at the landscape level (Fig 1). We found a significant negative relationship (r = -0.24; p = 0.023) between grid cell-specific tiger occupancy probability and AGBCS at the landscape level (Fig 5). In a total of 96 grid cells containing 11,087 km2 of potential habitat, total AGBCS estimated at 130.4 million tC with a mean occupancy probability estimate of 0.366 (SE 0.02).
Tiger bearing protected areas, corridors, and large forest connectivity blocks contain 56.7 million tC (~119 tC/ha), 33.0 million tC (~117 tC/ha), and 40.6 million tC (~117 tC/ha), respectively. The probability of tiger occupancy (Psi, ) ranged between: (1) min = 0.08 and max = 1.00 for protected areas; (2) min = 0.04 and max = 0.63 for corridors; and (3) min = 0.01 and max = 0.33 for large forest connectivity blocks, respectively.
Discussion
This is the first study to document and explore the relationship between the estimates of AGBCS and tiger population metric (population density &amp; occupancy probability). The major findings of the study have been 1) significant negative relationship between tiger density &amp; AGBCS in CNP, and between tiger occupancy &amp; AGBCS in the landscape level, 2) tiger density of 0.0135 tiger per 0.33 km2 is equivalent to mean total of 43.7 tC/ha in CNP, 3) mean landscape occupancy = 0.366 is equivalent to mean AGBCS of 116 tC/ha in the landscape, and 4) Comparatively, site-specific variation in tiger occupancy and its equivalent AGBCS: medium in tiger corridors and large connectivity dispersal blocks, while high in tiger bearing protected areas.
Although the data set was part of the Gurung et al. [20], analysis was conducted at different scales (plot, protected areas, and landscape) makes a variation in AGBCS findings but comparable result between the studies. As expected, our AGBCS estimated for protected areas (including CNP) ranged between 150156 tC/ha falls within lower range of estimates 178 ± 42.63 tC/ha (Gurung et.al. 2015). Similarly, the mean AGB reported here in different conservation unit, largely within subtropical climate, can be comparable as highlighted in Bordoloi et. al. [43] with the AGB estimates of 16.76 to 173.72 Mg/ha (18.47191.5 tC/ha) from subtropical forest of Chenzhou City in China [44] and 160 Mg/ha (176.37 tC/ha) reported from subtropical community forest of Nepal [45]. Variation in AGBCS, yet comparable, along the potential tiger habitat differed between conservation units. AGBCS with 119 tC/ha in protected areas falls under the strict protection regime, while large forest connectivity blocks and corridor at 116 tC/ha falls under the combination of protection and utilitarian regime. We found more average AGB carbon (~3 tC/ha) in protected areas, albeit by low margin, than in non-protected areas regime. Among various reasons including composition and extent of patches, their protection measure status for protecting carbon biomass could be one factor [46] for more AGBCS within protected areas. Non-protected area regimes (corridors and large forest connectivity blocks) allow the harvesting of the forest such as fuelwood, timber, and non-timber forest products for the discrepancy in carbon content. This also supports the argument that carbon stock is higher in protected areas than in non-protected areas highlighted in many studies in Southeast Asia [47], India [48], and Nepal [49]. The Government of Nepals target to increase the protection regime to 30% by 2030 from the current 24% and maintaining 45% of total area under forest cover as committed in country position paper under Global Biodiversity Framework in CoP 15 in 2022 and Second Nationally Determined Contributions submitted to the International Paris Agreement in CoP 24 in 2020. These commitments and targets are positive steps in increasing carbon content in its policy targets and shall contribute both to, biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration, respectively.
There was a negative relationship between tiger density &amp; occupancy probability with AGBCS. Our observation on the inferred relationship between AGBCS and tiger density &amp; occupancy probability seems reasonable and obvious. Tiger population parameters (such as density and occupancy estimates) are dependent upon prey density [39, 50]. Ungulate density is high in the riverine complex and generally low in the sal forest [51] across the TAL-Nepal. The clear positive relationship between tiger density and prey density (Karanth et al. 2004) supports this contention. For any carnivores including tigers, habitat selection is a key process shaping ecological communities through predator-prey interactions [52]. It is to be noted that with the exclusion of the riverine subset, albeit weak negative relation persists, more transition towards the positivity in relationship (r = -0.22 to -0.08) between AGBCS and tiger density. Thus, the contribution of riverine forest (~2% coverage) in the landscape is subtle yet extremely important for the survival of the tiger and its prey and other species of global importance megafauna such as greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). Trewia nudiflora-Bombax ceiba-Acacia spp. assemblages in riverine forest and mixed forest types are identified along riparian zones in association with riverine grasslands assemblages [53].
We found site-specific variations: high carbon /low-population density &amp; occupancy sites, low carbon/high-population density &amp; occupancy sites along with the various habitat types including grassland collectively identified as potential tiger habitat. Carbon conservation needs to keep harmony in managing between pioneer forest (dry) to riparian zones (wet) for maintaining healthy tiger density and occupancy in the landscape. Protected area is managed as per the management plan where enriching biodiversity conservation is a priority. Active habitat management in low carbon-rich ecosystems such as floodplain grassland including rich riverine forest and degraded scrubland can be managed to boost prey population for enriching tiger populations [54, 55]. In corridors, carbon-rich forests can be managed as per local needs co-benefiting local diversity by taking an integrated approach [56, 57]. Khata corridor in Western TAL takes in an integrated approach with sustainable management of carbon-rich forest and benefiting the local biodiversity that also facilitates the tiger dispersal between protected areas [25]. As a caveat, the study explored the relationship between the metrics the tiger population and AGBCS and, results alone should not be treated as management treatments for enriching tiger recovery or carbon stock per se.
Tiger densities are high along the riverine and floodplain grassland habitat [51], thus maintaining the riverine and grassland habitat does support conservation of AGBCS, albeit low in content, with mutual benefits to tiger conservation. River valley corridors along the plains and mid-hills do provide an opportunity for enhancing AGBCS and conserving the habitat as a refuge for dispersing tigers. Riverine forest and grasslands along river valleys in East Rapti, Narayani, West Rapti, Babai, Karnali, and Mahakali Rivers are linked to sources sites of tigers such as Chitwan, Banke, Bardia, and Shuklaphanta National Parks and are potential to increase a AGBCS while providing habitat for their dispersal specially under climate change when most other areas could be less inhabitable.
Conclusions
This study assessed forest carbon status along the conservation units defined for tiger conservation such as corridors, large forest connectivity blocks, and protected areas and explored relationship carbon and tiger conservation in terms of above-ground biomass carbon stock, tiger population density, and occupancy probabilities. It has been observed that maintenance/restoration of existing forest habitat and/or mosaic habitat (riverine forest and grassland) would still be preferable for both tiger (0.06 per 0.33 km2) and carbon conservation (80.47 tC/ha). Within the CNP, inducting the activity centers of tigers (sigma value ~4.1 km) provide extent of the all the tiger captured with the national park covering range of habitat (~2,044 km2) and protection of these potential habitat provides opportunity to conserve rich carbon (~ 30.19 mtC). Management of grassland habitat is critical for recovery of tiger prey population. Result shows that grassland stores relatively less biomass carbon than other habitat type. However, grassland habitat also stores highest amount of soil carbon relative to other habitat types such as forest [58, 59]. Considering carbon stock from biomass and soil, CNP grassland habitat represent more resilient carbon sinks and could store more carbon, comparable to other habitat types. Further empirical research is anticipated considering carbon stock above and below the surface in this space.
Government of Nepals periodic species conservation action plan for major flagship species including tiger can also integrate carbon conservation potential while managing habitat through strategic actions. This urged to species- and site-specific management strategy that also focuses on habitat management plans on riparian habitat (forest and grassland) and low transitional state forest (degraded scrubland) providing opportunities to generate win-win solution, sequester more carbon, and provide better habitat for tiger.
We note that our study design has drawn a relationship from limited sampling data, covering limited area and habitat types, but we used a published dataset for elucidating total carbon stocks. More research using larger sample size, covering larger area and habitat types, is required to determine if our findings are indicative of broader area and elucidating biological reason for cause-and-effect relationship.

You would not think that something as innocuous as yogurt would rile authorities in China. But last August, a yogurt festival in Tibet was met with a police crackdown.
Shoton is the Tibetan Yogurt Festival, and typically includes traditional performances, a feast (involving yogurt, of course) and unveiling of the Thangka, a large portrait of the Buddha. But this year there was a decidedly different atmosphere: a heavy Chinese police presence, prohibitions on engagement in religious and public gatherings, and inspection booths to confirm the identities of participants and devotees. For an event so anodyne, such restrictions sent a clear message to Tibetans from Chinese authorities: your traditions are not welcome.
The incident at the yogurt festival is just one example of Chinas far-reaching and intensifying crackdown on Tibetan culture and heritage.
October marks the 73rd anniversary of the Peoples Liberation Armys invasion of Tibet in 1950, which soon led to Tibets annexation in 1959 and the self-exile of the Dalai Lama. China has long purported to have a centuries-old claim to sovereignty over the region, and Tibetans have since endured harsh conditions of imprisonment, violence, and oppression. As Chinas policy of ethnic unity increasingly takes hold, Tibetan heritage is, and has been, under attack.
Political persecution and forced assimilation have steadily escalated as Tibetans struggle to preserve their culture, faith, and history while navigating a life in which core elements of their identity are not only seen as separatist, but also disobedient. Religion is central to all aspects of life in Tibet, and the majority population practices Buddhism; significant numbers also practice Bon, Tibets indigenous religion, as well as Islam and Christianity. Historically, religion has been a vital component of Tibetan identity, community, and cultural heritage.
Tibet possesses a wealth of tangible and intangible heritage, with sacred sites at the heart of daily life, political administration, and learning. Monasteries and temples are therefore symbolic of not only Tibetan religion but also culture and identityand for good reason: monasteries are important institutes of academic study, as well as the study of medicine, crafts, rituals, and professional trades. Many monasteries have also held printing houses for liturgical texts to be conserved and passed on; this makes them vital to the transmission of inter-generational knowledge and the preservation of the Tibetan language. During the Cultural Revolution that spread to Tibet in the 1960s, many of these structures were destroyed or damaged.
Monasteries and temples are also vital to Tibetan heritage because they serve as centers where the sacred relationship between teacher and student is cultivated. The teacher-student relationship functions not only as a method of spiritual study, but also of passing on oral traditions, debates, and intangible heritage. The International Campaign for Tibet notes that this tradition was unbroken until Chinese occupation in 1959.
Chinese attempts to exercise control and oppress the Tibetan people have only intensified, and policies of sinicization, the intentional assimilation of non-Chinese groups into Chinese culture, have escalated and become entrenched. These policies prohibit Tibetans from offering prayers to the Dalai Lama in public as well as images of the Dalai Lama himself. The display of the highly symbolic Tibetan prayer flags and celebration of many important Tibetan festivals have also been forbidden. As such, many monasteries and religious events have become subject to regular surveillance.
Even more, Mandarin is now an official language of Tibet, and schools force Tibetan students to learn Mandarin with curricula focused on Han Chinese culture; the teaching of the Tibetan language is increasingly banned in schools in the region. The pervasiveness of these policies into the realm of education threatens the survival of the Tibetan language as well as future generations knowledge of their own history and culture.
Sinicization also poses a threat to the spiritual integrity of sacred sites themselves; since 2020, two Chinese-style pavilions were constructed outside of Jokhang Temple, widely considered the holiest temple in Tibet, in the capital city of Lhasa. The differences in architectural style significantly contrast with that of Jokhang, jeopardizing the preservation of the sites symbolic landscape. 
In addition to the changes engendered by sinicization, the physical destruction of religious heritage is of acute concern. The Cultural Revolution saw the demolition of thousands of monasteries as well as sacred artifacts, scriptures, and statues. Such devastation has since continued, including the 2016 destruction of Larung Gar, the largest Buddhist academy in the world, and the forced eviction of thousands of students, monks, and nuns living around it. Many were subjected to brutality and political re-education; reasons have included purported overpopulation, implementation of land rights claims, and infrastructure development projects.
Increasingly clear is that this destruction is not an anomaly in Chinas exertion of control, but rather characteristic of its occupation; the International Campaign for Tibet approximates that of the roughly 6,000 monasteries that once existed in Tibet, only 13 have been left undamaged. This strategy has also been employed in Chinas assault on Uyghur Muslims, a population increasingly subject to cultural cleansing. Not only have Uyghurs endured the persecution of groups due to their religious or ethnic affiliations, but also the systematic erasure of their customs and destruction of their cultural heritage.
For Tibetans, religion is also deeply intertwined with humanitys relationship to their surroundings. Many natural sites that have been long-considered sacred are now endangered by resource exploitation and development projects that hinder faith activities. Mount Kailash and Lake Mapham in Western Tibet, for example, are significant holy sites vulnerable to such risks, putting the survival of their spiritual landscape for current and future generations in danger.
An effective path forward must recognize the profound link between religion, culture, and Tibetan identity. Physical embodiments of religion, such as artifacts, scriptures, monasteries, temples, and sacred natural sites are symbols of historical significance, as well as of Tibetans themselves. The Chinese Communist Party recognizes this, which is why it has worked to erode these links. The destruction and exploitation of these sites is devastating to Tibetan historical and religious values, and Tibetan identity itself.
Spreading awareness of this connection is vital, as is the urgent need for protective action by organizations such as UNESCO that have the power to identify and monitor these sacred sites. The next meeting of the World Heritage Committee could elect Tibetan sites or intangible heritage to the World Heritage List. Similarly, continued pressure applied to Chinese authorities for their disregard for and implementation of these policies is crucial to this effort. Otherwise, Tibets culture, language, and historyas well as its peoples right to religious freedom itselfrisk a tragic disappearance.
The systematic destruction of heritage and sacred sites is a form of cultural genocide that threatens to erase the histories, cultures, and identities of at-risk populations around the world. Chinese policies of sinicization in Tibet are emblematic of this. Recognition of the symbolic power of Tibets sacred sites and the intangible heritage they protect is the first step to safeguarding Tibets past and future. It is also essential to preserving the rights of those dedicated to ensuring its survival.

Introduction
Human-wildlife interactions occur when human and wildlife live in close proximity [1] and share common resources including food and shelter [2]. Rapid human population growth and competition for resources has increased the frequency of conflicts with wildlife [3], exacerbated in and near protected areas where wildlife is often more abundant [4]. Conflicts were mainly due to increasing wildlife crime associated with increased demand for wildlife and their body parts [5], livestock and crop depredation, attacks on humans, and property damage [6]. Losses from wildlife including crop damage [7], livestock depredation [8], and human injuries or death [9, 10] increase negative attitudes of people toward wildlife [11]. These negative attitudes can adversely affect many wildlife species due to retaliatory killing [11, 12].
Human-wildlife conflicts are generally more severe to farmers who live in rural communities [8, 13, 14]. These individuals can lose 1015% of their total agricultural production from wildlife damage [15, 16]. For example, in Bardia National Park, Nepal, 70% of respondents interviewed experienced crop damage by Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) [17]. In Chitwan National Park, Nepal, crop damage represented 70% of all human-wildlife conflicts reported during 20132017 [18].
However, human injury or death from wildlife attacks is also a serious form of conflict worldwide. For example, more than 100 people are killed annually by Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in Mozambique and Namibia [15] and in Tanzania during 19902004 more than 563 people were killed and about 308 injured from lions (Panthera leo; [19]). In Nepal, attacks on people are largely by large mammals including tigers (P. tigris; [20]), leopards (P. pardus; [21, 22]), greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis; [23]), Asian elephants; [24]) and Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus; [25]). Around 1139 large mammal and 887 human deaths were recorded in Nepal between 20002020 [10] which demonstrates the serious threats on wildlife survival and human mortality. In addition, almost 800 incidents of crop damage by Asian elephants (n = 517) and greater one-horned rhino (n = 280) and 357 livestock depredation events by tigers (n = 77) and leopards (n = 280) were reported from Nepal annually [10]. In protected areas of Nepal, the incidences of wildlife attacks can also threaten human livelihood, for example, 4,014 wildlife incidents with humans, livestock, crops, and other property damage occurred in Chitwan National Park [26]. In contrast, in Shuklaphanta National Park, only one human death and five injuries were recorded during 20162020 [27, 28]. These conflicts typically occur when wildlife enter human settlements due to human expansion into areas of suitable habitat [29].
Natural areas are also increasingly exploited due to increasing human populations which has altered the global landscape [30]. The rise in human population in Nepal (e.g., 14% during 20012011 [31]) has resulted in encroachment of wildlife habitats, the compression of species into small habitat areas, and direct competition with local communities [32]. Illegal and unmanaged settlements in and around protected area can hinder conservation and activities such as logging, grazing, and poaching have harmed wildlife populations and their habitat [32].
Various management tools such as deterrents, barriers and lethal control are used to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts globally [33]. Numerous methods are also used in Nepal to reduce the frequency and severity of human-wildlife conflicts. For example, electric fencing can be highly effective in reducing crop damage [34]. Other exclusion and deterrent techniques include constructing livestock pens with barbed-wire [35] and cultivating unpalatable crops [36]. Compensatory and incentive-based programs also have been used in local communities to reduce costs of human-wildlife conflicts such as community-based conservation and integrated conservation and development projects [34, 35, 37, 38]. Nepal Government paid &gt;400,000 US dollar to the victim between 1998 and 2016 as a relief in Chitwan National Park, Nepal [26]. Despite some differences between these compensatory and incentive-based programs, the term incentive-based programs have been used to describe projects intended to balance conservation with the livelihoods of local residents near protected areas [35, 39].
With recent incidents including elephant attacks resulting in multiple human deaths and injuries [29] and a human fatality from a tiger attack [40], human-wildlife conflicts are becoming an increasingly serious issue in and near Shuklaphanta National Park (ShNP), Nepal. Since ShNP encompasses a large area including nine community-use buffer zones and 42 community forests, it is critical to local peoples livelihoods. Human-wildlife conflicts in ShNP have reportedly resulted in negatives attitude toward wildlife by local people [29], but the frequency and magnitude of conflicts and mitigation techniques used have not been characterized adequately. Our objective was to quantify the type, frequency, and timing of human-wildlife conflicts and to identify measures taken by ShNP personnel to address these conflicts.
Study area
Shuklaphanta National Park (28°4547""-29°0252""N and 80°0545""-80°2143""E) comprises 305 km2 in southwestern Nepal (Fig 1). The park was established as a Wildlife Reserve in 1979 before being designated a national park in 2017. The park is bounded by settlement forests and the Dadeldhura District in the north, the Syali River in the East, the Indian border (Grasslands of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve and Lagga Bagga forests) in the south, and the Mahakali River in the west. Most of ShNP occurs in the Gangetic floodplain with elevations from 175 to 1300 m above sea level. The climate is tropical monsoon with average monthly minimum and maximum temperatures of 7 and 37 C, respectively. The park area has more than 665 plant species [41], 56 reptiles, 15 amphibians, 423 bird and 53 mammal species [42]. Mammal species include sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), leopard, Asian elephant, wild boar (Sus scrofa), and greater one-horned rhino [41].
The buffer zone of ShNP contains 34 wards within five Municipalities and two Rural Municipalities including Bhimdatta Municipality (Ward No. 1319), Bedkot Municipality (Ward No. 9 and 10), Belauri Municipality (Ward No. 9), Mahakali Municipality (Ward No. 110), Shuklaphanta Municipality (Ward No. 17 and 12), Beldadi Rural Municipality (Ward No. 2,4 and 5) and Laljhadi Rural Municipality (Ward No. 3, 4 and 6). There are about 27067 households in the study area [43] and major occupations are laborer and agriculture. Important crops grown include wheat, corn, sugarcane, and bananas; dominant livestock includes cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep, and pigs.
Methods
We collected secondary and primary data on wildlife attacks. Secondary data included household size, the number of wildlife attacks on humans, livestock, crops, and property and economic losses from 20162021, available from ShNP office. We collected names and locations of 900 households who reported their losses or casualties to ShNP officials. For primary data, we conducted a questionnaire survey with affected local people. Prior to fieldwork and interview, we also received written consents from the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (Permission letter number 1619) and written consents from participating individuals.
From these 900 household we selected 300 households for the questionnaire survey by random sampling method using the rand() command in MS excel [44]. Though the minimum required sample size is 270 households for a 95% confidence interval with 5% margin of error, we selected 300 households at random across 34 wards (Bhimdatta Municipality Ward No. 1319, Bedkot Municipality Ward No. 9 and 10, Belauri Municipality Ward No. 9, Mahakali Municipality Ward No. 110, Shuklaphanta Municipality Ward No. 17 and 12, Beldadi Rural Municipality Ward No. 2,4 and 5 and Laljhadi Rural Municipality Ward No. 3, 4 and 6 for the survey. We conducted the survey during 28 September 20218 January 2022, interviewing one person &gt;18 years old from each household; individuals selected were not based on education level, gender, ethnicity, or religion. We requested demographic data including age, gender, education level, family size, religion, and socio-economic conditions. Whenever possible, we interviewed people who witnessed the conflict or were victims of attacks on humans and requested they show us the site where the incidents occurred, then recorded the location using hand-held GPS. In the event of wildlife attacks resulting in death, we interviewed the victims relative or an eyewitness.
We asked whether respondents experienced conflicts from wildlife including attacks on humans, livestock or crop depredation, or property loss. We also asked whether mitigation measures were implemented following conflicts and if these measures reduced conflicts. We categorized conflicts as attacks on humans (death or injury), livestock depredation (buffalo, cattle/oxen, goat/sheep), crop depredation (wheat, rice, corn, mustard, potato, or sugarcane), or property loss. We used Chi-square and Man-Whitney U Tests for categorical and continuous data, respectively.
We used generalized linear models to identify factors affecting livestock and crop depredation. For livestock depredations, we used the total reported number of livestock killed during 20162021 as the response variable and predictive variables were number of livestock owned (cattle/ox, buffalo, and goat/sheep), distance (adjacent [&lt;500 m] or distant [500 m]) to ShNP, season (summer [MayOctober] or winter [NovemberApril]) and whether mitigation measures (e.g., electric fencing, wire, and barbed wire) were conducted by ShNP personnel (yes or no). We categorized distance from the park boundary as near (500 m) and far (&gt;500 m) because the livelihood of the people living near and far from the park is influenced by park activities. For crop damage, we used total crop damage for the response variable, and predictive variables including hectares of land owned, distance to ShNP, whether mitigation measures were conducted by ShNP personnel, and whether preventive measures (e.g., setting fires, and noise making including use of fire crackers) were conducted by the respondents (yes or no). We compared models using Akaikes information criterion for small samples (AICc) and model weights [45] and selected the model for livestock and crop depredation with lowest AICc score. We estimated economic loss using the market value of the loss from the compensation log book of ShNP. We estimated the monetary value of crop loss based on the annual sale price of each crop, then converted livestock and crop losses to USD using the Nepal Rastra Banks exchange rate. We performed all analyses in program R [46] with significance established using = 0.05.
Results
Most respondents (77.6%, n = 233) lived near ShNP. There were no differences in attributes of respondents based on gender, education, age, or occupation living adjacent or distant to the park boundary (Table 1). However, people adjacent to ShNP owned more livestock (median = 5) than people living distant (median = 4) (Man-Whitney Test, W = 9129.5, p = 0.033). Overall, we documented 626 reported human-wildlife conflicts with 78% adjacent to ShNP and conflicts occurring up to 5 km from the park boundary.

Human casualties
Wildlife attacked 19 people including 9 injuries and 1 death from wild boars adjacent to ShNP, 5 (4 adjacent) by Asian elephants, 3 by leopards distant to ShNP, and 1 near ShNP by a greater one-horned rhino. Ten victims were male and 9 were female; average victim age was 46 years old (range = 1176 years). More attacks occurred during summer (14 adjacent) than in winter (1 adjacent, 4 distant) (2 = 14.632, df = 2, p &lt; 0.001). Attacks were near homes or agricultural land (7 each), 3 were along roads, and two were within ShNP. More attacks on humans occurred during the day (11 adjacent, 4 distant) than at night (4 adjacent).
Livestock depredation
Leopard was the only species involved in livestock depredations, with most attacks (64.0%, n = 58) adjacent to ShNP. Of 92 livestock depredations, 84.8% were goats/sheep, followed by cattle, and buffalo (Fig 2). More reported depredations occurred in summer (57.6%) than in winter (42.4%). The livestock depredation was increased with increasing the number of livestock in summer season at low practices area of mitigation measures (Table 2).

Crop damage
Most respondents cultivated rice (n = 264), followed by wheat (n = 263), potato (n = 238), mustard (n = 235), maize (n = 223) and sugarcane (n = 51). Of the 267 respondents that grew crops, 96.4% (209 adjacent, 48 distant) experienced crop damage. More reported crop depredations occurred at night (n = 233) than during day (n = 48); crop damage occurred from germination to harvest, with most damage during harvest.
The number of crop raiding events decreased distant from ShNP. However, the likelihood of crop damage increased with increasing number of mitigation measures, area under production, but did not with increased use of preventative measures (Table 3). Greatest overall economic losses of crops were by Asian elephants, followed by wild boars (Table 4, Fig 3). Overall economic loss to farmers was estimated to be USD 103,335 including rice (USD 41,608), followed by sugarcane was USD 39,990, wheat (USD 19,412), mustard (USD 1,138), corn (USD 701) and potato (USD 484) during 20162022.

Property damage
Asian elephants reportedly damaged property on 22 occasions, including 19 homes, 2 sheds, and 1 oil seed store, with overall estimated economic loss of USD 5972. All incidents occurred at night and damage was more severe adjacent to ShNP. No other species were reportedly involved with property damage.
Effectiveness of mitigation measures
Of the 300 respondents, 65.7% reported that conflicts were reduced after implementinge mitigation measures, while 28.0% said it increased increasing, and 6.3% respondents said no change (Fig 4). Two hundred and four respondents had knowledge of mitigation measures used by the park. More respondents 76.9% (n = 154, near = 128, far = 26) agreed there were decreased conflicts with wildlife due to the effective implementation of mitigation measures. However, 18.4% (n = 38, near = 34, far = 4) respondents mentioned increased conflicts, and 1.7% (n = 7, near = 7) reported no change (Fig 4).

Discussion
The magnitude of human-wildlife conflict was greater in the proximity to the National Park. Most people living here depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, which in turn relies on adjacent natural resources and increases human-wildlife conflicts [47]. That males and females are directly involved in agricultural activities, including equal involvement in protecting crops from damage, supports the similar numbers attacked by wildlife. Wildlife attacks generally occurred during the day when people are outside working on their farms, similar to previous studies of wildlife attacks on humans [48, 49].
Most conflicts were carnivore attacks on human and livestock by carnivores, which results in negative attitudes toward them [50]. In addition to carnivores, the wild boar was the species most frequently involved in attacks on humans, potentially due to their greater abundance in protected areas [5153] across the country. Most attacks occurred during summer in agricultural lands and near homes might be due to few grazing areas inside the park [54], or that wild boars move to open habitat near human settlements during summer to forage on crops [55]. That attacks were more frequently distant from ShNP is likely due to wild boars seeking forage in buffer zone forests and thus increasing the chances of interactions with humans [56, 57]. Further, respondents described wild boars as acting aggressively when people attempted to deter them from cultivated areas.
Most livestock depredations occurred adjacent to ShNP; populations of carnivores are increasing across protected areas throughout Nepal [58]. Greater frequency of livestock depredations during summer is likely related to the increased time livestock spend grazing in pastures [59], compared to being kept in enclosed sheds during winter. Goats were most frequently depredated by leopards in part because of their greater abundance. Further, leopards preferred prey range in size from 2 to 40 kg [60, 61] and across domestic prey species, leopards select smaller-sized hoofed animals such as goats and sheep [62, 63]. Livestock depredation by wildlife also occurs in areas where livestock can free-range or when shelters are poorly constructed and facilitate access by carnivores like leopards [64]s. Improved animal husbandry practices including secure enclosures, installing stronger fencing, and providing stall feeding could reduce incidents of wildlife predation on livestock [65].
Abundance of wildlife increased following establishment of ShNP [27], while the amount of forest cover during this period has declined [24]. This dynamic of increasing wildlife and decreasing forest area has resulted in increased foraging use of cultivated lands by wild herbivores, likely due in part to reduced natural forage [66]. Before the 1950s, most of the Tarai Region of Nepal was unoccupied due to the high risk of malaria. However, after eradication of malaria and government resettlement schemes, the human population in this region has increased exponentially [67]. That crop damage was more common adjacent to ShNP might be due to the higher forest cover in the edge of ShNP [68]. Encroachment into elephant habitat by humans is a leading cause of crop damage by Asian elephants [69]. Asian elephants in this study likely caused property damage and injured people while searching for food [70].
Wild boars frequently damaged agricultural crops, likely because of their high abundance in and around the protected areas of Nepal [51] and preference for agricultural crops over native forage [71]. The most frequently damaged crop in our study area was rice, which is selected over other crops and grown extensively throughout Nepal [28, 72]. Further, previous studies in human wildlife conflicts in ShNP found that damage to rice accounted for nearly 70% of total crop loss [73]. Most crops were damaged by wildlife during harvest when their nutritional value [74, 75] and palatability [72] are greater.
In contrast to our expectations, the likelihood of crop damage increased with the increased number of mitigation measures. This might be due to incomplete or inconsistent use of mitigation measures or a consequence of areas otherwise experiencing frequent conflicts and higher amounts of loss, or that mitigation measures are resolving human-wildlife conflict locally but shifting the problems to adjacent areas [76]. Similarly, though mitigation measures may reduce the impact of large mammals like elephant and rhino, they are appear less effective for wild boar, deer, and other smaller-bodies mammals [34].
Based on the results of this study we offer several recommendations to mitigate wildlife damage. To reduce wildlife attacks on humans, timely identification and management of wildlife and public awareness program should be implemented [38]. Further, establishment of well-equipped and prepared emergency rescue teams, awareness by local people of conflict prone areas and areas of species movements, and enforced regulation and potential limitations of anthropogenic activities in and around protected areas should be considered [32]. To reduce livestock losses, we recommend improved animal husbandry practices such as night-penning and consideration of livestock insurance from a government managed relief fund which could include compensation limits [3537]. Adopting alternative crops that are less palatable or bee keeping could reduce crop damage by some species [36]. Electric fencing could also be used effectively to reduce all forms of conflicts identified in this study [34]. These and other techniques implemented in an integrated approach are likely needed to maximize reduction of human-wildlife conflicts in and near ShNP.

352,,Mount Everest,"The peak of Mount Everest is 29,035 ft (8,850 m) above sea level, making it the highest point on earth. It is called Chomo-Lungma, or ""Mother of the Universe,"" by the Tibetans, and Devgri in Sanskrit, meaning ""Holy Mountain."" The first confirmed ascent of the mountain took place in 1953, by Hillary of New Zealand and Norgay of Nepal; however, whether George Mallory had successfully ascended the mountain in 1924 before dying is a matter of controversy.

Mount Everest (Chinese: 珠穆朗玛Zhūmùlǎngmǎ; Nepali: सगरमाथाSagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungmaཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[5] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) was most recently established in 2020 by the Nepali and Chinese authorities.[6]
Mount Everest attracts many climbers, some of them highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the ""standard route"") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as significant hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of 2019, over 300 people have died on Everest,[7] many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.[8]
The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). Seven porters were killed in an avalanche on the descent from the North Col. The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top. They had been spotted high on the mountain that day but disappeared in the clouds, never to be seen again, until Mallory's body was found in 1999 at 8,155 m (26,755 ft) on the north face. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first official ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on 25 May 1960.[9]
Name
The Tibetan name for Everest is Qomolangma (ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ, lit. ""Holy Mother""). The name was first recorded with a Chinese transcription on the 1721 Kangxi Atlas during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of Qing China, and then appeared as Tchoumour Lancma on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French geographer D'Anville based on the former map.[10] It is also popularly romanised as Chomolungma and (in Wylie) as Jo-mo-glang-ma.[15] The official Chinese transcription is 珠穆朗玛峰(t珠穆朗瑪峰), whose pinyin form is Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng. While other Chinese names exist, include Shèngmǔ Fēng(t聖母峰,s圣母峰,lit. ""Holy Mother Peak""), these names largely phased out from May 1952 as the Ministry of Internal Affairs of China issued a decree to adopt 珠穆朗玛峰 as the sole name.[16] Documented local names include ""Deodungha"" (""Holy Mountain""), but it is unclear whether it is commonly used.[17]
In the late 19th century, many European cartographers incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was Gaurishankar, a mountain between Kathmandu and Everest.[18]
In 1849, the British survey wanted to preserve local names if possible (e.g., Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri), and Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India argued that he could not find any commonly used local name, as his search for a local name was hampered by Nepal and Tibet's exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued that because there were many local names, it would be difficult to favour one name over all others; he decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India.[19][20][21] Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that ""Everest"" could not be written in Hindi nor pronounced by ""the native of India"". Waugh's proposed name prevailed despite the objections, and in 1865, the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted Mount Everest as the name for the highest mountain in the world.[19][22] The modern pronunciation of Everest (/ˈɛvərɪst/)[23] is different from Sir George's pronunciation of his surname (/ˈiːvrɪst/EEV-rist).[24]
In the early 1960s, the Nepali government coined the Nepali name Sagarmāthā (IAST transcription) or Sagar-Matha[25] (सागर-मथ्था, [sʌɡʌrmatʰa], lit. ""goddess of the sky""[26]).[27]
Surveys
19th-century surveys
In 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometric Survey of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing 500 kg (1,100 lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were turned down.[19]
The British were forced to continue their observations from Terai, a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and malaria. Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health.[19]
Nonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to 240 km (150 mi) distant. Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year. In November 1847, Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas. Kangchenjunga was then considered the highest peak in the world, and with interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about 230 km (140 mi) away. John Armstrong, one of Waugh's subordinates, also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak ""b"". Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak ""b"" was higher than Kangchenjunga, but given the great distance of the observations, closer observations were required for verification. The following year, Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak ""b"", but clouds thwarted his attempts.[19]
In 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two observations from Jirol, 190 km (120 mi) away. Nicolson then took the largest theodolite and headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being 174 km (108 mi) from the peak.[19]
Nicolson retreated to Patna on the Ganges to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average height of 9,200 m (30,200 ft) for peak ""b"", but this did not consider light refraction, which distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak ""b"" was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael Hennessy, one of Waugh's assistants, had begun designating peaks based on Roman numerals, with Kangchenjunga named Peak IX. Peak ""b"" now became known as Peak XV.[19]
In 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun, Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson's measurements.[28] An official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta. Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8,582 m (28,156 ft), while Peak XV was given the height of 8,840 m (29,002 ft). Waugh concluded that Peak XV was ""most probably the highest in the world"".[19] Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing more than a rounded estimate.[29] Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being ""the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest"".[30]
20th-century surveys
In 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometric Survey.[31] The 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given is officially recognised by Nepal and China.[32] Nepal plans a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.[33]
In 1955, the elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) was first determined by an Indian survey, made closer to the mountain, also using theodolites. In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 8,848.13 m (29,029.30 ft).[34] In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured. In May 1999 an American Everest Expedition, directed by Bradford Washburn, anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[35] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[36] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 [See below] surveys. 
In 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse. 
In the late 1980s, an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive aerial photography.[37]
21st-century surveys
On 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 8,844.43 m (29,017.16 ft) with accuracy of ±0.21 m (8.3 in), claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date.[38][39] This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it. The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),[34] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.[40]
It is thought that the plate tectonics of the area are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards. Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4 mm (0.16 in) per year (upwards) and 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) per year (northeastwards),[35][41] but another account mentions more lateral movement (27 mm or 1.1 in),[42] and even shrinkage has been suggested.[43]
China—Nepal compromise
The actual height of the mountain had been disputed by Nepal and China, the two countries that share the mountain. On December 8, 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,032 feet).[44] This was 0.86 m (2.8 ft) higher than had been previously officially calculated. Chinese authorities had argued previously Everest should be measured to its rock height, while Nepali authorities asserted the snow on top of the summit should be included.[45]
Comparisons
Further information: List of highest mountains on Earth
The summit of Everest is the point at which earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the ""tallest mountains on earth"". Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base;[46] it rises over 10,200 m (33,464.6 ft) when measured from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level. 
By the same measure of base to summit, Denali, in Alaska, also known as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well.[46] Despite its height above sea level of only 6,190 m (20,308 ft), Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300 to 900 m (980 to 2,950 ft), yielding a height above base in the range of 5,300 to 5,900 m (17,400 to 19,400 ft); a commonly quoted figure is 5,600 m (18,400 ft).[47][48] By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4,200 m (13,800 ft) on the south side to 5,200 m (17,100 ft) on the Tibetan Plateau, yielding a height above base in the range of 3,650 to 4,650 m (11,980 to 15,260 ft).[37]
The summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is 2,168 m (7,113 ft) farther from earth's centre (6,384.4 km (3,967.1 mi)) than that of Everest (6,382.3 km (3,965.8 mi)), because the earth bulges at the equator.[49] This is despite Chimborazo having a peak 6,268 m (20,564.3 ft) above sea level versus Mount Everest's 8,848 m (29,028.9 ft). 
Geology
Geologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations.[50][51] Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle faults, called detachments, along which they have been thrust southward over each other. From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation. 
The Qomolangma Formation, also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation,[52] runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band, about 8,600 m (28,200 ft) above sea level. It consists of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded, Ordovicianlimestone interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with argillaceous laminae and siltstone. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone.[53][54] Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites, crinoids, and ostracods. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering thrombolite bed that is 60 m (200 ft) thick comprises the foot of the ""Third Step"", and base of the summit pyramid of Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about 70 m (230 ft) below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria, in shallow marine waters. The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that terminate at the low angle normal fault, the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.[50][51][55]
The bulk of Mount Everest, between 7,000 and 8,600 m (23,000 and 28,200 ft), consists of the North Col Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms its upper part between 8,200 to 8,600 m (26,900 to 28,200 ft). The Yellow Band consists of intercalated beds of Middle Cambriandiopside-epidote-bearing marble, which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown, and muscovite-biotitephyllite and semischist. Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about 8,300 m (27,200 ft) found it to consist as much as five percent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles. The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A 5–40 cm (2.0–15.7 in) thick fault breccia separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation.[50][51][55]
The remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between 7,000 to 8,200 m (23,000 to 26,900 ft) on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble. Between 7,600 and 8,200 m (24,900 and 26,900 ft), the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-sericite-quartz schist. Between 7,000 and 7,600 m (23,000 and 24,900 ft), the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of quartzose marble. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea flysch composed of interbedded, mudstone, shale, clayey sandstone, calcareous sandstone, graywacke, and sandy limestone. The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called the ""Lhotse detachment"".[50][51][55]
Below 7,000 m (23,000 ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest. It consists of sillimanite-K-feldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1 cm to 1,500 m (0.4 in to 4,900 ft).[51][56] These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late Oligocene–Miocene intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.[57]
Mount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia.[58][59][60] Current interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it collided with Asia. The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them southward and upward.[61][62] The Rongbuk Formation consists of a sequence of high-grade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived from the alteration of high-grade metasedimentary rocks. During the collision of India with Asia, these rocks were thrust downward and to the north as they were overridden by other strata; heated, metamorphosed, and partially melted at depths of over 15 to 20 kilometres (9.3 to 12.4 mi) below sea level; and then forced upward to surface by thrusting towards the south between two major detachments.[63] The Himalayas are rising by about 5 mm per year. 
Flora and fauna
There is very little native flora or fauna on Everest. A moss grows at 6,480 metres (21,260 ft) on Mount Everest.[64] It may be the highest altitude plant species.[64] An alpine cushion plant called Arenaria is known to grow below 5,500 metres (18,000 ft) in the region.[65] According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region. Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare.[66]
Euophrys omnisuperstes, a minute black jumping spider, has been found at elevations as high as 6,700 metres (22,000 ft), possibly making it the highest confirmed non-microscopic permanent resident on Earth. It lurks in crevices and may feed on frozen insects that have been blown there by the wind. There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes.[67]
Birds, such as the bar-headed goose, have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain, while others, such as the chough, have been spotted as high as the South Col at 7,920 metres (25,980 ft).[68] Yellow-billed choughs have been seen as high as 7,900 metres (26,000 ft) and bar-headed geese migrate over the Himalayas.[69] In 1953, George Lowe (part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary) said that he saw bar-headed geese flying over Everest's summit.[70]
Yaks are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs. They can haul 100 kg (220 pounds), have thick fur and large lungs.[65] One common piece of advice for those in the Everest region is to be on the higher ground when around yaks and other animals, as they can knock people off the mountain if standing on the downhill edge of a trail.[71] Other animals in the region include the Himalayan tahr which is sometimes eaten by the snow leopard.[72] The Himalayan black bear can be found up to about 4,300 metres (14,000 ft) and the red panda is also present in the region.[73] One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants.[74]
Meteorology
In 2008, a new weather station at about 8,000 m altitude (26,246 feet) went online.[78] The station's first data in May 2008 were air temperature −17 °C (1 °F), relative humidity 41.3 percent, atmospheric pressure 382.1 hPa (38.21 kPa), wind direction 262.8°, wind speed 12.8 m/s (28.6 mph, 46.1 km/h), global solar radiation 711.9 watts/m2, solar UVA radiation 30.4 W/m2.[78] The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011.[78][79] The solar-powered weather station is on the South Col.[80]
One of the issues facing climbers is the frequent presence of high-speed winds.[81] The peak of Mount Everest extends into the upper troposphere and penetrates the stratosphere,[82] which can expose it to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream.[83] In February 2004, a wind speed of 280 km/h (175 mph) was recorded at the summit and winds over 160 km/h (100 mph) are common.[81] These winds can blow climbers off Everest. Climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window in the spring and fall when the Asian monsoon season is either starting up or ending and the winds are lighter. The air pressure at the summit is about one-third what it is at sea level, and by Bernoulli's principle, the winds can lower the pressure further, causing an additional 14 percent reduction in oxygen to climbers.[83] The reduction in oxygen availability comes from the reduced overall pressure, not a reduction in the ratio of oxygen to other gases.[84]
In the summer, the Indian monsoon brings warm wet air from the Indian Ocean to Everest's south side. During the winter, the west-southwest flowing jet stream shifts south and blows on the peak. 
Expeditions
Because Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as both of the men making the attempt failed to return from the mountain. Several climbing routes has been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.[85][86]
Overview
Everest's first known summiting occurred by 1953, and interest by climbers increased.[87] Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had sumitted by 1987.[87] Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.[88]
By March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.[89] Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km/h (200 mph) when the weather shifts.[90] At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.[91] Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.[91]
By 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.[92]
Early attempts
In 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book Above the Snow Line.[93]
The northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7,005 metres (22,982 ft). From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared for the great task of climbing any further and descended. 
The British returned for a 1922 expedition. George Finch climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed—290 metres (951 ft) per hour, and reached an altitude of 8,320 m (27,300 ft), the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and Col. Felix Norton made a second unsuccessful attempt. Mallory was faulted for leading a group down from the North Col which got caught in an avalanche. Mallory was pulled down too but survived. Seven native porters were killed. 
The next expedition was in 1924. The initial attempt by Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp VI. The next attempt was that of Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather, traversing the North Face into the Great Couloir. Norton managed to reach 8,550 m (28,050 ft), though he ascended only 30 m (98 ft) or so in the last hour. Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner. 
On 8 June 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made an attempt on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory's body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29 years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. 
In 1933, Lady Houston, a British millionairess, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of two aeroplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the Everest summit.[94][95][96][97]
Early expeditions—such as Charles Bruce's in the 1920s and Hugh Ruttledge's two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936—tried to ascend the mountain from Tibet, via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.[98]
The 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition, led by Edouard Wyss-Dunant, was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7,986 m (26,201 ft). Raymond Lambert and SherpaTenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about 8,595 m (28,199 ft) on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953.[99] One reference says that no attempt at an ascent of Everest was ever under consideration in this case,[100] although John Hunt (who met the team in Zurich on their return) wrote that when the Swiss Expedition ""just failed"" in the spring they decided to make another post-monsoon (summit ascent) attempt in the autumn; although as it was only decided in June the second party arrived too late, when winter winds were buffeting the mountain.[101]
First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953
Main article: 1953 British Mount Everest expedition
In 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within 100 m (330 ft) of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber. They reached the summit at 11:30 local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first.[102] They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending. 
News of the expedition's success reached London on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, 2 June. A few days later, the Queen gave orders that Hunt (a Briton) and Hillary (a New Zealander) were to be knighted in the Order of the British Empire for the ascent.[103] Tenzing, a Nepali Sherpa who was a citizen of India, was granted the George Medal by the UK. Hunt was ultimately made a life peer in Britain, while Hillary became a founding member of the Order of New Zealand.[104] Hillary and Tenzing have also been recognised in Nepal. In 2009, statues were raised in their honor, and in 2014, Hillary Peak and Tenzing Peak were named for them.[105][106]
1950s–1960s
On 23 May 1956 Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended.[107] This was followed by Dölf Reist and Hans-Rudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957.[107] Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960.[9] The first American to climb Everest, Jim Whittaker, joined by Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on 1 May 1963.[108][109]
1970s
See also: 1970 Mount Everest disaster
In 1970 Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centerpiece was a large ""siege""-style expedition led by Saburo Matsukata, working on finding a new route up the southwest face.[110] Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest.[88] Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes.[88] However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. For example, Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col (he descended nearly 4,200 vertical feet from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries). Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route.[88][111][112] Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.[113]
 In 1975, Junko Tabei, a Japanese woman, became the first woman to summit Mount Everest.[88]
In 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen. 
1979/1980: Winter Himalaism
The Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier in early January 1980. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 meters above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col (7906 m). Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50 am on 17 February. At 2:40 pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio – ""We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time. It is unimaginably cold.""[114][115][116][117] The successful winter ascent of Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a Polish specialisation. After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks, which earned Polish climbers a reputation of ""Ice Warriors"".[118][115][119][120]
Lho La tragedy, 1989
In May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit. But on 27 May in the avalanche from the wall Khumbutse on the Lho La Pass, four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wacław Otręba. The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak also died. Marciniak, who was also injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part. In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part, inter alia Reinhold Messner, Elizabeth Hawley, Carlos Carsolio and the US consul.[121]
1996 disaster
Main article: 1996 Mount Everest disaster
On 10 and 11 May 1996 eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche. The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialization of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest. 
Journalist Jon Krakauer, on assignment from Outside magazine, was in one of the affected guided parties, and afterward published the bestseller Into Thin Air, which related his experience. Anatoli Boukreev, a guide who felt impugned by Krakauer's book, co-authored a rebuttal book called The Climb. The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community. 
In May 2004, Kent Moore, a physicist, and John L. Semple, a surgeon, both researchers from the University of Toronto, told New Scientist magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge approximately 14 percent.[122][123]
One of the survivors was Beck Weathers, an American client of New Zealand-based guide service Adventure Consultants. Weathers was left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain, Weathers managed to make it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness.[124] When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight.[125]
Weathers' condition had not improved and an immediate descent to a lower elevation was deemed essential.[125] A helicopter rescue was out of the question: Camp 4 was higher than the rated ceiling of any available helicopter. Weathers was lowered to Camp 2. Eventually, a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the Nepali Army.[124][125]
The storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by British filmmaker and writer Matt Dickinson in his book The Other Side of Everest. 16-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account, Within Reach: My Everest Story. 
The 2015 feature film Everest, directed by Baltasar Kormákur, is based on the events of this guiding disaster.[126]
2006 mountaineering season
In 2006 12 people died. One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics.[130] The season was also remembered for the rescue of Lincoln Hall who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain. 
David Sharp ethics controversy, 2006
There was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber David Sharp, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal.[131] He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a ""loose group"", offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide.[132] It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.[131]
Double-amputee climber Mark Inglis said in an interview with the press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang 450 metres (1,480 ft) below the summit, without attempting a rescue.[133] Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed ""Green Boots"",[134] but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman, Burçak Poçan). There has also been some discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was ""...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite – he later had five fingertips amputated."" When they went through Sharp's possessions they found a receipt for US$7,490, believed to be the whole financial cost.[135] Comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to US$100,000 plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses.[136] It was estimated on 14 May that Sharp summitted Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down.[137] On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 1,000 feet from the summit on the North Side route.[137]
""Dawa from Arun Treks also gave oxygen to David and tried to help him move, repeatedly, for perhaps an hour. But he could not get David to stand alone or even stand to rest on his shoulders, and crying, Dawa had to leave him too. Even with two Sherpas, it was not going to be possible to get David down the tricky sections below.""
Some climbers who left him said that the rescue efforts would have been useless and only have caused more deaths. Beck Weathers of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster said that those who are dying are often left behind and that he himself had been left for dead twice but was able to keep walking.[139]The Tribune of India quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as ""the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering"".[140] In addition to Sharp's death, at least nine other climbers perished that year, including multiple Sherpas working for various guiding companies.[141]
""You are never on your own. There are climbers everywhere.""
Much of this controversy was captured by the Discovery Channel while filming the television program Everest: Beyond the Limit. A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber Lebanese adventurer Maxim Chaya is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager (Russell Brice) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from frostbite, preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him. 
David Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to ""Green Boots""; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them.[137] Sharp's body was removed from the cave in 2007, according to the BBC,[143] and since 2014, Green Boots has been missing, presumably removed or buried.[144]
Lincoln Hall rescue, 2006
As the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left for dead the day before.[145] He was found by a party of four climbers (Dan Mazur, Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down. Hall later fully recovered. His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks.[145] There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned.[146] The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family. The next day he was discovered by another party alive.[147]
I was shocked to see a guy without gloves, hat, oxygen bottles or sleeping bag at sunrise at 28,200-feet height, just sitting up there.
Lincoln greeted his fellow mountaineers with this:[147]
I imagine you are surprised to see me here.
Lincoln Hall went on to live for several more years, often giving talks about his near-death experience and rescue, before dying from unrelated medical issues in 2012 at the age of 56 (born in 1955).[147]
2007
Heroic rescue actions have been recorded since Hall, including on 21 May 2007, when Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista. Recognising her heroic rescue, Major Meagan McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.[148]
Ascent statistics up to 2010 season
By the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77% of these ascents being accomplished since 2000.[149] The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014.[149] In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 sherpas.[149]
An illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents. Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was considered unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May 2010, the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers – more summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 through 1983.[149]
There have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition through the end of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a general rate, and includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5%) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent.[149] Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits, with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and 2 on the north face.[149]
Nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes. The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. In 2005–07, more than half of all climbers elected to use the more challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season, and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for carrying the Olympic torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics.[150] The route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile.[151] These closures led to declining interest in the north route, and, in 2010, two-thirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south.[149]
2010s
Main articles: Mount Everest in 2012 and Mount Everest in 2013
The 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back to back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades. However, other years set records for numbers of summits – 2013's record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak,[152] and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters.[153]
2014 avalanche and season
Main article: 2014 Mount Everest avalanche
On 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below the Base Camp 2 at around 01:00 UTC (06:30 local time) and at an elevation of about 5,900 metres (19,400 ft).[161] Sixteen people were killed in the avalanche (all Nepali guides) and nine more were injured.[162]
During the season, a 13-year-old girl, Malavath Purna, reached the summit, becoming the youngest female climber to do so.[163] Additionally, one team used a helicopter to fly from south base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, then reached the Everest summit. This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. A team member (Jing Wang) donated US$30,000 to a local hospital.[164] She was named the Nepali ""International Mountaineer of the Year"".[164]
Over 100 people summited Everest from China (Tibet region), and six from Nepal in the 2014 season.[165] This included 72-year-old Bill Burke, the Indian teenage girl, and a Chinese woman Jing Wang.[166] Another teen girl summiter was Ming Kipa Sherpa who summited with her elder sister Lhakpa Sherpa in 2003, and who had achieved the most times for woman to the summit of Mount Everest at that time.[167] (see also Santosh Yadav) 
2015 avalanche, earthquake, season
Main article: 2015 Mount Everest avalanches
2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China). However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp,[168] effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season.[169] 18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team.[170] The avalanche began on Pumori,[171] moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp.[172] 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche.[173][174] One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks (over 50 percent according to the USGS).[175] Just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks.[176]
The quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies.[177] The quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to climbers.[177] Bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult.[177] The Everest tragedy was small compared the impact overall on Nepal, with almost nine thousand dead[178][179] and about 22,000 injured.[178] In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died, and 117 were injured.[180] By 29 April 2015, the Tibet Mountaineering Association (North/Chinese side) closed Everest and other peaks to climbing, stranding 25 teams and about 300 people on the north side of Everest.[181] On the south side, helicopters evacuated 180 people trapped at Camps 1 and 2.[182]
Mountain re-opens in August 2015
On 24 August 2015 Nepal re-opened Everest to tourism including mountain climbers.[183] The only climber permit for the autumn season was awarded to Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki, who had tried four times previously to summit Everest without success. He made his fifth attempt in October, but had to give up just 700 m (2,300 ft) from the summit due to ""strong winds and deep snow"".[184][185] Kuriki noted the dangers of climbing Everest, having himself survived being stuck in a freezing snow hole for two days near the top, which came at the cost of all his fingertips and his thumb, lost to frostbite, which added further difficulty to his climb.[186]
Some sections of the trail from Lukla to Everest Base Camp (Nepal) were damaged in the earthquakes earlier in the year and needed repairs to handle trekkers.[187]
2016 season
Main article: Mount Everest in 2016
Hawley's database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016.[188]
2017 season
Main article: Mount Everest in 2017
2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths.[189] On 27 May 2017, Kami Rita Sherpa made his 21st climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people in the World along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit of Mount Everest 21 times.[190][191] The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck of Switzerland, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb.[192] There was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the Hillary Step.[193] Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648.[159] 449 summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side).[194]
2018
Main article: Mount Everest in 2018
807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018,[195] including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet side.[152] This broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season.[152][196][160] Various records were broken including a summit by a 70-year-old double-amputee Hari Budha Magar, who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the Nepali Supreme Court.[152] There were no major disasters, but seven climbers died in various situations including several sherpas as well as international climbers.[152] Although record numbers of climbers reached the summit, old-time summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost.[196]
Himalayan record keeper Elizabeth Hawley died in late January 2018.[197]
Figures for the number of permits issued by Nepal range from 347[198] to 375.[199]
2019
The spring or pre-monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of a number of climbers and worldwide publication of images of hundreds of mountaineers queuing to reach the summit and sensational media reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world.[202][203][204][205]
There were reports of various winter expeditions in the Himalayas, including K2, Nanga Parbat, and Meru with the buzz for the Everest 2019 beginning just 14 weeks to the weather window.[206] Noted climber Cory Richards announced on Twitter that he was hoping to establish a new climbing route to the summit in 2019.[206] Also announced was an expedition to re-measure the height of Everest, particularly in light of the 2015 earthquakes.[207][208] China closed the base-camp to those without climbing permits in February 2019 on the northern side of Mount Everest.[209] By early April, climbing teams from around the world were arriving for the 2019 spring climbing season.[160] Among the teams was a scientific expedition with a planned study of pollution, and how things like snow and vegetation influence the availability of food and water in the region.[210] In the 2019 spring mountaineering season, there were roughly 40 teams with almost 400 climbers and several hundred guides attempting to summit on the Nepali side.[211][212][213] Nepal issued 381 climbing permits for 2019.[195] For the northern routes in Chinese Tibet, several hundred more permits were issued for climbing by authorities there.[214]
In May 2019, Nepali mountaineering guide Kami Rita summited Mount Everest twice within a week, his 23rd and 24th ascents, making international news headlines.[215][211][212] He first summited Everest in 1994, and has summited several other extremely high mountains, such as K2 and Lhotse.[211][212][213][215]
By 23 May 2019, about seven people had died, possibly due to crowding leading to delays high on the mountain, and shorter weather windows.[195] One 19-year-old who summited previously noted that when the weather window opens (the high winds calm down), long lines form as everyone rushes to get the top and back down.[216] In Chinese Tibet, one Austrian climber died from a fall,[195] and by 26 May 2019 the overall number of deaths for the spring climbing season rose to 10.[217][218][219] By 28 May, the death toll increased to 11 when a climber died at about 26,000 feet during the descent,[200] and a 12th climber missing and presumed dead.[201] Despite the number of deaths, reports indicated that a record 891 climbers summited in the spring 2019 climbing season.[220][153]
Although China has had various permit restrictions, and Nepal requires a doctor to sign off on climbing permits,[220] the natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with medical issues aggravated by Everest's extreme altitude led to 2019 being a year with a comparatively high death toll.[220] In light of this, the government of Nepal is now considering reviewing its existing laws on expeditions to the mountain peak.[221][222]
Regardless of the number of permits, the weather window impacts the timing of when climbers head to the summit.[223] The 2018 season had a similar number of climbers, but an 11-day straight calm, while in 2019 the weather windows were shorter and broken up by periods of bad weather.[223][224]
By 31 May 2019, the climbing season was thought to be all but concluded, as shifting weather patterns and increased wind speed make summiting more difficult.[225] The next window is generally when the monsoon season ends in September; however, this is a less popular option as the monsoon leaves large amounts of snow on the mountain, thus increasing the danger of avalanches,[226] which historically account for about one quarter of Everest fatalities.[153]
2020
Both Nepal and China prohibited foreign climbing groups during the 2020 season, due to the Coronovirus. 2020 was the third year in this decade after 2014 and 2015 which saw no summits from the Nepal (South) Side.[227]
A team of Chinese surveyors climbed Mt. Everest from the North side during April-May 2020, becoming the only climbers to summit the world's highest peak during the coronavirus pandemic, at least through May. The team was there to re-measure the height of Mount Everest.[228]
Climbing
Permits
334 climbing permits were issued in 2014 in Nepal. These were extended until 2019 due to the closure.[230] In 2015 there were 357 permits to climb Everest, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017 (not to 2019 as with the 2014 issue).[231][230]
In 2017, a permit evader who tried to climb Everest without the $11,000 permit faced, among other penalties, a $22,000 fine, bans, and a possible four years in jail after he was caught (he had made it up past the Khumbu icefall) In the end he was given a 10-year mountaineering ban in Nepal and allowed to return home.[232]
The number of permits issued each year by Nepal is listed below.[231][233]
<ul><li>2008 – 160</li><li>2009 – 220</li><li>2010 – 209</li><li>2011 – 225</li><li>2012 – 208</li><li>2013 – 316</li><li>2014 – 326 (extended for use in any year up to 2019)</li><li>2015 – 356 (extended for use in any year up to 2017)</li><li>2016 – 289</li><li>2017 – 366–373 (last year for 2015 extended permits)</li><li>2018 – 346</li><li>2019 – 381 (last year for 2014 extended permits)</li></ul>The Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest.[234] They did not issue permits in 2008, due to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest.[235]
In March 2020, the governments of China and Nepal announced a cancellation of all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[236][237] In April 2020, a group of Chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the Chinese side. The mountain remained closed on the Chinese side to all foreign climbers.[238]
Routes
Mount Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes.[239] Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996.[239] This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet.[240]
Most attempts are made during May, before the summer monsoon season. As the monsoon season approaches, the jet stream shifts northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain.[241][242] While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons' tail end makes climbing extremely difficult. 
Southeast ridge
The ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into Lukla (2,860 m) from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar. Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness.[243] Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks, dzopkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time. 
Climbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the altitude. During that time, Sherpas and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall. 
Seracs, crevasses, and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route. Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section. To reduce the hazard, climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn, when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place. 
Above the icefall is Camp I at 6,065 metres (19,900 ft). 
From Camp I, climbers make their way up the Western Cwm to the base of the Lhotse face, where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp (ABC) is established at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). The Western Cwm is a flat, gently rising glacial valley, marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre, which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm. Climbers are forced to cross on the far right, near the base of Nuptse, to a small passageway known as the ""Nuptse corner"". The Western Cwm is also called the ""Valley of Silence"" as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route. The high altitude and a clear, windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers.[244]
From Advanced Base Camp, climbers ascend the Lhotse face on fixed ropes, up to Camp III, located on a small ledge at 7,470 m (24,500 ft). From there, it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the South Col at 7,920 m (26,000 ft). 
From Camp III to Camp IV, climbers are faced with two additional challenges: the Geneva Spur and the Yellow Band. The Geneva Spur is an anvil shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition. Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snow-covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble, phyllite, and semischist, which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.[244]
On the South Col, climbers enter the death zone. Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude. That's one reason why clear weather and low winds are critical factors in deciding whether to make a summit attempt. If the weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp. 
From Camp IV, climbers begin their summit push around midnight, with hopes of reaching the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within 10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach ""The Balcony"" at 8,400 m (27,600 ft), a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn. Continuing up the ridge, climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waist-deep snow, a serious avalanche hazard. At 8,750 m (28,700 ft), a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the South Summit.[244]
From the South Summit, climbers follow the knife-edge southeast ridge along what is known as the ""Cornice traverse"", where snow clings to intermittent rock. This is the most exposed section of the climb, and a misstep to the left would send one 2,400 m (7,900 ft) down the southwest face, while to the immediate right is the 3,050 m (10,010 ft) Kangshung Face. At the end of this traverse is an imposing 12 m (39 ft) rock wall, the Hillary Step, at 8,790 m (28,840 ft).[245]
Hillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step, and they did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopes—though the exposure on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent years, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain. 
After the Hillary Step, climbers also must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather. Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in, to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather, or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out. 
North ridge route
The north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet. Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier, setting up base camp at 5,180 m (16,990 ft) on a gravel plain just below the glacier. To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse, at around 6,100 m (20,000 ft). Camp III (ABC—Advanced Base Camp) is situated below the North Col at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at 7,010 m (23,000 ft). From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around 7,775 m (25,500 ft). The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at 8,230 m (27,000 ft). From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push. 
Climbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step: ascending from 8,501 to 8,534 m (27,890 to 28,000 ft), to the crux of the climb, the Second Step, ascending from 8,577 to 8,626 m (28,140 to 28,300 ft). (The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the ""Chinese ladder"", a metal ladder placed semi-permanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers.[246] It has been almost continuously in place since, and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route.) Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over, ascending from 8,690 to 8,800 m (28,510 to 28,870 ft). Once above these steps, the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees, to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached.[247]
Summit
The summit of Everest has been described as ""the size of a dining room table"".[248] The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year.[249] The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low-grade metamorphic rock.[250] (see the 'Surveys' section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit) 
Below the summit there is an area known as ""rainbow valley"", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) is an area commonly called the ""death zone"", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.[82]
Below the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides, or faces, of Mount Everest: the North Face, the South-West Face, and the East/Kangshung Face.[251]
Death zone
At the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone (altitudes higher than 8,000 metres (26,000 ft)), and face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air. Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur. High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers. 
Another significant threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or 0.333 standard atmospheres (337 mbar), resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe.[252]
Debilitating effects of the death zone are so great that it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres (1.07 mi) from South Col to the summit.[253] Achieving even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude acclimatisation, which takes 40–60 days for a typical expedition. A sea-level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above 8,500 m (27,900 ft) without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within 2 to 3 minutes.[254]
In May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest undertook a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests were performed to examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests on the way to the summit.[255] Even at base camp, the low partial pressure of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. At sea level, blood oxygen saturation is generally 98–99%. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87%. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate, often 80–90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20–30. Exhaustion can occur merely attempting to breathe.[256]
Lack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky. People who die during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2006, about 150 bodies had never been recovered. It is not uncommon to find corpses near the standard climbing routes.[257]
Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest. Profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early features associated with subsequent death.
— Mortality on Mount Everest, 1921–2006: descriptive study[258]
A 2008 study noted that the ""death zone"" is indeed where most Everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit.[259] A 2014 article in The Atlantic about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes.[260] However, Everest climbing is more deadly than BASE jumping, although some have combined extreme sports and Everest including a Russian who base-jumped off Everest in a wingsuit (he did survive, though).[261]
Despite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period.[262] Some examples are Kangchenjunga, K2, Annapurna, Nanga Parbat, and the Eiger (especially the nordwand).[262]Mont Blanc has more deaths each year than Everest, with over one hundred dying in a typical year and over eight thousand killed since records were kept.[263] Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.[263]
Another health hazard is retinal haemorrhages, which can damage eyesight and cause blindness.[264] Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and ended up dying in the death zone.[264]
At one o'clock in the afternoon, the British climber Peter Kinloch was on the roof of the world, in bright sunlight, taking photographs of the Himalayas below, ""elated, cheery and bubbly"". But Mount Everest is now his grave, because only minutes later, he suddenly went blind and had to be abandoned to die from the cold.
The team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections.[265] Even for the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save anyone in such a difficult spot.[265] One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies.[266] They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to Namche Bazaar in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.[266]
Supplemental oxygen
Most expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft).[267] Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk. Humans' ability to think clearly is hindered with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions. While about 95 percent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top, about five percent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen.[268] Travelling above 8,000 feet altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia.[269] This decrease of oxygen to the brain can cause dementia and brain damage, as well as other symptoms.[270] One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes.[271]
Brain cells are extremely sensitive to a lack of oxygen. Some brain cells start dying less than 5 minutes after their oxygen supply disappears. As a result, brain hypoxia can rapidly cause severe brain damage or death.

The use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial. It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition by George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce who climbed up to 7,800 m (25,600 ft) at a spectacular speed of 1,000 vertical feet per hour (vf/h). Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next day they climbed to 8,100 m (26,600 ft) at 900 vf/h—nearly three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate. 
George Mallory described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924.[272] When Tenzing and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they also used open-circuit bottled oxygen sets, with the expedition's physiologist Griffith Pugh referring to the oxygen debate as a ""futile controversy"", noting that oxygen ""greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing.""[273] For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit. 
...although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen, one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function.
— Thomas F. Hornbein in The high-altitude brain[271]
Reinhold Messner was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with Peter Habeler, made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it should be climbed.[26]:154
The aftermath of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate. Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air (1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summitted after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain. 
The 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide's role in using bottled oxygen.[274]
Guide Anatoli Boukreev's decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote The Climb) state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security.[275] Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.[276] They state that Boukreev said that he was going down with client Martin Adams,[276] but just below the south summit, Boukreev determined that Adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving Adams behind. Adams states in The Climb, ""For me, it was business as usual, Anatoli's going by, and I had no problems with that.""[277]
The low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as ""delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia"" even after returning to lower altitudes.[278] In severe cases, climbers can experience hallucinations. Some studies have found that high-altitude climbers, including Everest climbers, experience altered brain structure.[278] The effects of high altitude on the brain, particularly if it can cause permanent brain damage, continue to be studied.[278]
Autumn climbing
Although generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the ""post-monsoon season"").[65][279] For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years.[279] The first mainland British ascent of Mount Everest (Hillary was from New Zealand), which was also the first ascent via a face rather than a ridge, was the autumn 1975 Southwest Face expedition led by Chris Bonington. The autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable.[280] However, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding.[65] Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973.[281]
Chris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year, the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the Los Angeles Times.[282] By the 21st century, summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest.[283] During the 1980s, climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring.[284] U.S. astronaut Karl Gordon Henize died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition, conducting an experiment on radiation. The amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes.[285]
The mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days.[286] By January the peak is typically battered by 170 mph (270 km/h) winds and the average temperature of the summit is around −33 °F (−36 °C).[65]
Selected climbing records
By the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals.[149] Some notable ""firsts"" by climbers include:

Summiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam, a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013.[312] A teenager with Down's syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery.[313] Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches. Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis (no legs), Paul Hockey (one arm only), and Arunima Sinha (one leg only). 
In 2001, Erik Weihenmayer became the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest while blind. Andy Holzer followed in 2017. 
Fake ascents
In 2021, Nepal banned three Indians for faking an ascent of Mt Everest in 2016.[314][315] In 2017, two Indian police officers, supposedly the first couple to ascend Mt Everest, were sacked once it was found they had faked their ascent.[314]
Aviation
1933: Flight over Everest
Main article: Houston–Mount Everest flight expedition
Lucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933. A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain .[316]
1988: First climb and glide
On 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest,[295] in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. Boivin said: ""I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard.""[317] Boivin ran 18 m (60 ft) from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at 5,900 m (19,400 ft) in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes).[317][318] Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, base-jumping off Venezuela's Angel Falls.[319]
1991: Hot air balloon flyover
In 1991 four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Everest.[320] In one balloon was Andy Elson and Eric Jones (cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson (cameraman).[321] Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called Ballooning Over Everest.[321] The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to 40,000 feet altitude.[321] Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film, the ""best snap on Earth"", according to UK newspaper The Telegraph.[322] Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6 million per passenger.[320]
2005: Pilot summits with helicopter
In May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest.[323] He needed to land for two minutes to set the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice.[323] In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft. The flight set rotorcraft world records, for highest of both landing and take-off.[324]
Some press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier,[325] with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI.[324] Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at 4,880 m (16,000 ft) while he was there. One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue.[323]
2011 Paraglide off summit
On 21 May 2011 two Nepali paraglided from the Everest Summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes.[266][326] They had run out of oxygen and supplies, so it was a very fast way off the mountain.[266] The duo won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits.[327] After the paraglide they kayaked to the Indian Ocean, and they had made it to the Bay of Bengal by the end of June 2011.[327] One had never climbed, and one had never para-glided, but together they accomplished a ground-breaking feat.[327] By 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program Nightline.[328]
2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent
In 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit.[329] This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb.[164][330] Nepal ended up investigating Wang, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp 2, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall.[331] In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp 2 because the icefall was impassable. ""If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home,"" she said in an interview. In that same interview she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.[164]
Her team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepal's interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and provided the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world.[164] National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US$30,000 to the town's hospital. Wang won the International Mountaineer of the Year Award from the Nepal government in June 2014.[329]
2016: Helicopter business increases
In 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall.[332] In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest.[332] After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 deaths and earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though).[332] That summer Bell tested the 412EPI, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 18,000 feet and flying as high as 20,000 feet altitude near Mount Everest.[333]
Commercial climbing
According to Jon Krakauer, the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with only four years of climbing experience.[335] By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain. Rob Hall, one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster, had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident.[26]:24,42
By 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000–200,000.[336] Going with a ""celebrity guide"", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over £100,000 as of 2015.[337] However, the services offered vary widely and it is ""buyer beware"" when doing deals in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.[336][338] Tourism is about four percent of Nepal's economy, but Everest is special in that an Everest porter can make nearly double the nation's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.[339]
Costs beyond the guiding service can vary widely. It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are ""budget"" travel agencies which offer logistical support for such trips. A limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000 as of 2007.[135] However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of David Sharp). 
Climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US$8,000, and most climbers also use bottled oxygen, which adds around US$3,000. The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to US$25,000 per person, depending on the size of the team. The ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain, both of which are approximately 100 kilometres (60 mi) from Kathmandu and 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Lhasa (the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one's equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US$2,000. 
Many climbers hire ""full service"" guide companies, which provide a wide spectrum of services, including acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, fixed ropes,[340] medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000–80,000 per person.[341] Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas, clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under 10 kilograms (22 lb), or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast, climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like Denali, are often expected to carry backpacks over 30 kilograms (66 lb) and, occasionally, to tow a sled with 35 kilograms (77 lb) of gear and food.[342]
The degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism.[343]Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay, said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, ""You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on crampons. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others.""[344]
One example of this is Shriya Shah-Klorfine, who had to be taught how to put on crampons during her summit attempt in 2012.[345] She paid at least US$40,000 to a new guiding company for the trip, and lost her life when she ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours straight.[346]
Reinhold Messner concurred in 2004, ""You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain....High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and organisers tell clients, 'Don't worry, it's all organised.' The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don't care about the risks.""[347]
By 2015, Nepal was considering to require that climbers have some experience and wanted to make the mountain safer, and especially increase revenue.[348] One barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money not taking inexperienced climbers to the summit.[336] Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price—that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part way up the mountain.[336] Whereas a Western firm will convince those they deem incapable to turn back, other firms simply give people the freedom to choose.[336]
However, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers are strictly negative. For example, Edmund Hillary, who went on record saying that he has not liked ""the commercialisation of mountaineering, particularly of Mount Everest""[349] and claimed that ""Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all"",[350] nevertheless noted that he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, ""I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them.""[351]
One of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of Seven Summits fame) responded in an interview about Everest climbers and what it took to survive there, ""Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot mountain and 29,000 feet. It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [20,320 feet] or Aconcagua [22,834 feet] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I'm going to try Everest.' But it's not like that.""[352]
Law and order
The Tibetan/Chinese side has been described as ""out of control"" due to reports of thefts and threats.[353]
Some climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches. Vitor Negrete, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed.[354][355]
""Several members were bullied, gear was stolen, and threats were made against me and my climbing partner, Michael Kodas, making an already stressful situation even more dire"", said one climber.[356]
In addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book, High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed (2008):[357] unethical guides and Sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain.[358][359]
The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as ""out of control"" after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa.[353] Another sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. Hundreds of climbers pass by people's tents, making it hard to safeguard against theft.[353] In the late 2010s, the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.[360]
2014 Sherpa strike
On 18 April 2014, in one of the worst disasters to ever hit the Everest climbing community up to that time, 16 Sherpas died in Nepal due to the avalanche that swept them off Mount Everest. In response to the tragedy numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss.[361][362] Some still wanted to climb but there was too much controversy to continue that year.[361] One of the issues that triggered the work action by Sherpas was unreasonable client demands during climbs.[361]
Extreme sports at Mount Everest
Mount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping. 
Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly 4,200 vertical feet from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries.[88] Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001.[363] Other Everest skiers include Davo Karničar of Slovenia, who completed a top to south base camp descent in 2000, Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side,[364] and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006.[365] In 2006 Swede Tomas Olsson and Norwegian Tormod Granheim skied together down the north face. Olsson's anchor broke while they were rappelling down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8,500 metres, resulting in his death from a two and a half-kilometre fall. Granheim skied down to camp III.[366] Also, Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.[363]
Various types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986 Steve McKinney led an expedition to Mount Everest,[367] during which he became the first person to fly a hang-glider off the mountain.[318] Frenchman Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp.[295] In 2011, two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down 5,000 metres (16,400 ft) in 45 minutes.[368] On 5 May 2013, the beverage company Red Bull sponsored Valery Rozov, who successfully BASE jumped off of the mountain while wearing a wingsuit, setting a record for world's highest BASE jump in the process.[261][369]
Everest and religion
The southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several ""hidden valleys"" of refuge designated by Padmasambhava, a ninth-century ""lotus-born"" Buddhist saint.[370]
Near the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery, which has been called the ""sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world.""[371] For Sherpas living on the slopes of Everest in the Khumbu region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La.[102]
Miyolangsangma, a TibetanBuddhist ""Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving"", is believed to have lived at the top of Mt Everest. According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mt Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.[370]
The Sherpa people also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. Here, the karmic effects of one's actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.[370]
Waste management
In 2015 the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as ""26,500 pounds of human excrement"" each season is left behind on the mountain.[372] Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within meters of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 18,000 feet, Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 50-gallon barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed.[373]
The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.[374]
In February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits. Tourists are allowed to go as far as the Rongbuk Monastery.[375]
In April 2019, the Solukhumbu district's Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10,000 kg of garbage from Everest.[376]
Climate
Mount Everest has a polar climate (Köppen EF) with all months averaging well below freezing. Note: In the table below, the temperature given is the average lowest temperature recorded in that month. So, in an average year, the lowest recorded July temperature will be -18 degrees Celsius, and the lowest recorded January temperature will be -36 degrees Celsius.

Nearby peaks include Lhotse, 8,516 m (27,940 ft); Nuptse, 7,855 m (25,771 ft), and Changtse, 7,580 m (24,870 ft) among others. Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest. On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.

However, for a peak rising out of relatively flat terrain, such as Mauna Kea or Denali, an ""approximate"" height above ""base"" can be calculated. Everest is more complicated since it only rises above relatively flat terrain on its north (Tibetan Plateau) side. Hence the concept of ""base"" has even less meaning for Everest than for Mauna Kea or Denali, and the range of numbers for ""height above base"" is wider. In general, comparisons based on ""height above base"" are somewhat suspect.</li><li>^

353,Holly Walters,"Climate change threatens shaligrams, sacred fossils worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists for more than 2,000 years","For more than 2,000 years, Hinduism, Buddhism and the shamanic Himalayan religion of Bon have venerated shaligrams—ancient fossils of ammonites, a class of extinct sea creatures related to modern squids.",https://phys.org/news/2023-08-climate-threatens-shaligrams-sacred-fossils.html,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2023/climate-change-threate-7.jpg,2023-08-07T16:50:01Z,"For more than 2,000 years, Hinduism, Buddhism and the shamanic Himalayan religion of Bon have venerated shaligramsancient fossils of ammonites, a class of extinct sea creatures related to modern squids.
Originating from a single remote region in northern Nepalthe Kali Gandaki River Valley of Mustangshaligram stones are viewed primarily as manifestations of the Hindu god Vishnu. Because they are not human-made, but created by the landscape, they are believed to have an intrinsic consciousness of their own. As a result, shaligrams are kept in homes and in temples, where they are treated as both living gods and active community members.
I went on my first shaligram pilgrimage in 2015. After arriving at the village of Jomsom in Mustang, I, along with a group of Indian and Nepali pilgrims, started the five-day trek northeast from there to the temple of Muktinath, where the journey culminates.
Making our way through the winding river passage, between 26,000-foot (8,000-meter) mountain peaks, we carefully looked for shaligrams in the fast-moving water and gathered up any we could reach.
Since then, as an anthropologist, I have documented a wide variety of shaligram practices while working with devotees in Nepal and in India. In 2020 I wrote the first ethnographic account, ""Shaligram Pilgrimage in the Nepal Himalayas,"" which demonstrates how popular and important the pilgrimage is among South Asian and the wider global Hindu diasporas.
However, my ongoing work focuses more on how climate change and gravel mining are altering the course of the river, which is endangering the pilgrimage by making it harder to find shaligrams.
Living fossils
The mythology of shaligrams is associated with two legends. The first is told in a series of three Hindu scriptures, the Varaha, Padma and Brahmavaivarta Puranas.
In each version of this story, the Hindu god Vishnu, believed to be the supreme creator, is cursed by the goddess Tulsi, who is also called Brinda, because he compromises her chastity. As the story is told, Vishnu disguised himself as her husband Jalandhar so that the god Shiva could kill the demon in a fight. This was because Jalandhar, born from Shiva's third eye, had previously won a boon from the god Brahma that his wife's chastity would keep him invincible in any battle.
Angry at the deception, Tulsi transformed herself into a riverthe Kali Gandakiand turned Vishnu into a river stone, a shaligram. In this way, Vishnu would be continuously born from her, like a child, in repayment for the karmic debt of killing her husband and making her a widow. The landscape of Mustang thus represents the bodies of Tulsi and Vishnu, producing shaligram stones as divine manifestations from the waters of the Kali Gandaki.
The second legend is told in the Skanda Purana, which explains that shaligrams are physically created by a type of celestial worm called the vajra-kitatranslated as thunderbolt or adamantine wormwhich is responsible for carving out the holes and coiled spiral formations that appear on the stones.
As a result, the beliefs around the mythological formation of shaligrams involve both legends. As part of the first legend, Vishnu takes up residence within a sacred stone that appears in the Kali Gandaki River of Nepal. The story of the second legend is expressed in the carving of that stone by the vajra-kita to give it its uniquely smooth, rounded shape and the characteristic spirals both inside and on the surface.
Rivers and roads
Shaligram pilgrimage takes place high in the Himalayas, usually between April and June and again between late August and November. This helps avoid both the worst of the July monsoon rains and the December snows.
Mustang, however, is currently divided into the upper or the northern region and the lower or the southern region. In 1950, both Upper and Lower Mustang were closed to travel following China's annexation of Tibet. But though Lower Mustang was reopened to pilgrimage and trekking in 1992, Upper Mustang remains highly restricted.
This means that the current shaligram pilgrimage route does not include visiting the Damodar Kundthe glacial lake that produces shaligrams from the high-altitude fossil bedsbecause pilgrims are still not allowed to freely cross into Upper Mustang.
The village of Kagbeni marks the principal boundary between the two divisions and is also one of the main stops on the shaligram pilgrimage route. The village sits directly on the banks of the Kali Gandaki and is one of the few areas where pilgrims can reliably find significant numbers of shaligrams by wading through the river themselves and by watching the river bed for any signs of a black spiral emerging from the sand.
The last destination on the pilgrimage route, at roughly 13,000 feet (4,000 meters), is the temple site of Muktinath, which contains multiple sacred areas of worship for Hindus, Buddhists and followers of Bon. As a place of Hindu worship, Muktinath offers a central shrine to the deity Vishnu as well as 108 water spouts under which pilgrims must pass. The water spouts themselves are hammered directly into the mountain side, which contains a natural aquifer, and provide one last opportunity for practitioners to bathe themselves and their shaligrams in the waters of Mustang.
As a Bon sanctuary, Muktinath is home to the ""Jwala Mai,"" or the mother flame, a natural gas vent that produces a continuous flame that burns next to the constant flow of water from the mountain aquifer. Along with the high winds of the Himalayas, representing the element of air, and shaligrams, representing the element of stone, Jwala Mai contributes to Bon practitioners' view of Muktinath as a rare place where all of the sacred elements of their religion come together.
As a Buddhist complex, Muktinath is more commonly referred to as ""Chumig-Gyatsa,"" or the Hundred Waters, and the icon that is worshipped by Hindus as Vishnu is venerated by Buddhists as Avalokitevara, the bodhisattva of compassion. In 2016, Muktinath also became home to the largest statue of the Buddha ever built in Nepal.
Climate change and shaligrams
These traditions then come together to provide a place to ritually welcome all of the new shaligrams that have just been taken from the water into the lives of the people who venerate them. But shaligrams are becoming rarer.
Climate change, faster glacial melting, and gravel mining in the Kali Gandaki are changing the course of the river, which means fewer shaligrams are appearing each year. This is mainly because the Kali Gandaki is fed by meltwater from the Southern Tibetan Plateau. But with the glacier disappearing, the river is becoming smaller and shifting away from the fossil beds that contain the ammonites needed to become shaligrams.
For the moment, though, the majority of pilgrims are still able to find at least a few shaligrams every time they travel to Mustang, but it's getting harder. Even so, once the new shaligrams are introduced to worship at Muktinath, it is time for pilgrims to leave Mustang and return home.
For many, this is a bittersweet moment that marks the birth of their new household deities into the family but also means that they will be leaving the beauty of the high Himalayas and the place where deities come to Earth.
But all the pilgrims, me included, look forward to the days when we can return to walk the pilgrimage paths again, hopeful that shaligrams will still appear.

354,,Sacred Groves: How the Spiritual Connection Helps Protect Nature,"From Ethiopia’s highlands to Siberia to the Australian rainforest, there are thousands of sacred forests that have survived thanks to traditional religious and spiritual beliefs. These places, many now under threat, have ecological importance, experts say, and must be saved.Read more on E360 →",https://e360.yale.edu/features/sacred-groves-religion-forests,https://e360.yale.edu/assets/site/Shinto-Shrine_Alamy-Small-2.jpg,2023-01-04T09:36:31Z,"Governments from across the world made grand promises last month at the biodiversity conference in Montreal to save nature by protecting 30 percent of the planets land and oceans by 2030. But back home many are presiding over the destruction of some of the most ancient and precious protected areas on Earth sacred groves and places that have long been preserved by religious fervor and strict taboos that are often far more effective than game wardens or environmental statutes. 
Nobody knows how many sacred natural places there are across the world. They may number in the hundreds of thousands. Almost all societies have them from Hindu villages in India to Catholic communities in the hills of Italy, and native tribes of the Americas to African animists. The creation and longevity of these places are testament to the power of religion as a tool for community-based conservation. Sacred natural places are the oldest form of habitat protection in human history, says Piero Zannini of the University of Bologna, author of a 2021 assessment of their value. They are becoming ever more important as reservoirs of biodiversity.
In many places they are the only refuges for endangered species and rare ecosystems. Church forests are now almost the only trees left in the Amhara Province of Ethiopia, holding back advancing deserts. In Japan, there are few if any ancient lowland forests outside the grounds of Shinto temples, which are estimated to cover more than a quarter-million acres. 
Unlike state-supported parks and protected areas, there are few national and no international inventories of sacred groves.
Some have been adopted into national state-funded conservation networks. The Yosemite landscape in Californias Sierra Nevada was, says Zannini, considered sacred and protected as such by local [Native American] people for many centuries before being made a national park in 1890. But most remain a shadow conservation network.

Unlike state-supported parks and protected areas, there are few national and no international inventories of these sacred places. They are not getting sufficient attention from conservationists or the scientific community, he says. COP15 [the Montreal conference] and similar events are still neglecting sacred natural sites.
But Zannini warns that protecting these places will require more than simply integrating them into national protected-area networks. Many sacred natural sites, he says, are distinctive precisely because they exist separate from official conservation and may require special protection or designation. Protected areas are mostly large and remote, while sacred sites are smaller and mixed in among farms and people. The standardized management typical of protected areas could result in a loss of species that survive through interaction with human activities for example, species that are cultivated and harvested for medicines or that simply find habitat around farms, homes, or temple precincts.

In Europe, many sacred groves date back to pre-Christian and classical times. Celts, Druids, Gauls, Lithuanians, Finns, and Welsh all have histories of tending sacred groves. Many were wiped out by the spread of Christianity, which has often celebrated mankinds ascendancy over nature and preferred churches to sanctified nature. But not always. 
Fabrizio Frascaroli of the University of Zurich has plotted a network of Catholic sacred natural sites across central Italy, one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in Europe. They may have benefited from the continuing influence of a 13th-century nature-loving local, St. Francis of Assisi. But many were inherited from pre-Christian times. The sacred evergreen oak woodland at Monteluco in the hills of Umbria dates back at least to the third century B.C. and was originally dedicated to the Roman god Jupiter. 
In rural Estonia, a popular revivalist forest-worshiping movement called Maausk, claims links to pre-Christian pagans. Each village has its own sacred forest, where to this day disciples leave harvest gifts in the groves for their ancestors. Folklorists say the forests of this small Baltic nation have long been seen as bastions against outside influences, whether Lutheran Christians from Germany or Soviet Union invaders during the Second World War, when people sought refuge in the forests and a national resistance movement known as the Forest Brothers sprang up.
Elders in the foothills of the Himalayas say that up to 30 percent of their land was once protected as sacred.
Yet as Christian missionaries spread around the world, their crusades against pagan beliefs damaged the natural places those beliefs protected, says Indian ecologist Madhav Gadgil, who has pioneered research on these areas in his home country for half a century. Elders in the foothills of the Himalayas told him that up to 30 percent of their land was once protected as sacred.
Until recently, there were estimated to be more than 100,000 sacred natural sites across India, though only some 14,000 have been described by researchers. The countrys rapid economic development is taking its toll. Spiritual beliefs [are] no longer sufficient to ensure their survival, according to Gadgil. Yet just as there are no reliable statistics on their numbers, so are there none on their demise. 
But it is happening. In arid Rajasthan in northwest India, sacred stands of trees known locally as orans, derived from the Sanskrit word for forest have been protected for centuries as sources of firewood, water, and livestock fodder and for their spiritual and ecological value. Grazing helped maintain their ecology. But now they are being uprooted to make way for huge arrays of solar panels and attendant pylons.
The story is similar In China. Last months Montreal biodiversity conference was originally scheduled for Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, until Covid-19 intervened. Had foreign reporters gone to Yunnan, they might have uncovered a story of a catastrophic decline in sacred sites.

The distinctive montane rainforests forests protected on several hundred holy hills in Yunnan were traditionally held to be inhabited by gods of the Yi and Dai people. They were once out of bounds to humans, except when making sacrifices to the deities. According to Pei Shengji of the Kunming Institute of Botany, these trees recently have rarely been found anywhere else but on these holy mountainsides. But they are rapidly being lost as the sacred sites are taken over by rubber plantations.

In Siberia, meanwhile, many Indigenous communities have sacred sites in the boreal forests. Local shaman still oversee a network of them in the Karakol sacred valley in Russias Altai Republic, which is home to snow leopards. But the valleys sanctity and the leopards habitat is now threatened by construction of a pipeline to supply Siberian gas to China.
In Australia too, the clash between old religion and new economics often plays out over sacred sites. The countrys native Aborigines still recognize dreamtime sacred groves, ranging from spiritually significant rainforests in Queensland to woodlands in the arid interior. But threats increase. In 2020, highway engineers in the state of Victoria defied hundreds of protesters and began bulldozing some 200 trees sacred to local Djab Wurrung women.
Danger is often intrinsic to the aura of sacred groves. The most potent form of sacred grove protection is fear.” 
One tree slated for destruction was a giant 800-year-old, hollow at the base, that had been used as a shelter for giving birth by 50 generations of women. At another, Aboriginal women have long planted the placentas of their new-born babies as a connection to their ancestors. One 350-year-old tree was felled. But amid court cases, and the preparation of a new cultural heritage management plan for the area, the outcome of the decade-long standoff remains unclear.
In parts of Africa, traditions remain strong. The Ethiopian highlands have a patchwork of about 20,000 small forests surrounding Ethiopian Christian Orthodox Tewahedo churches and monasteries. They are the regions only remaining Afromontane forests, according to Travis Reynolds of the University of Vermont, who has studied them with local scholar Mesfin Sahle. But thanks to the protection of parishioners they have survived and extended their range in recent times, even while surrounding agricultural areas have turned to desert.
Often African sacred sites reflect animist traditions. The Kikuyu in Kenya protect groves of a fig tree called the mugumu for prayers, to honor ancestors, and as sites for animal sacrifices; in Ivory Coast, villagers host initiation ceremonies in protected areas; and in Sierra Leone, they grow medicinal plants.

But such sacred groves can be dangerous places, too. In Pondoland, an important region of plant endemism on the eastern coast of South Africa, the tiny damp and shaded sacred groves dotted among grazing pastures may look harmless. But locals told Yale Environment 360 in 2017 that they sometimes contain plants, secretly cultivated by villagers, that make poisons used in local vendettas and could have been used in a recent assassination.
Danger is often intrinsic to the aura of sacred groves, according to Jonathan Onyekwelu of the Federal University of Technology Akure in Nigeria. The most potent form of sacred grove protection is fear, he says. At the biodiverse Ogun-Onire sacred grove in southwest Nigeria, which he has studied, the traditional belief is that nobody enters and comes out alive, unless a sacrifice is made to the spirits beforehand.
Secrecy is another characteristic of many animist sacred sites. Sometimes knowledge of their biological wealth is deliberately kept close as a form of protection or even a tenet of their faith rendering the site invisible to the eyes of outsiders, according to Nigel Dudley, a British consultant ecologist and early advocate of sacred sites.
But such secrecy can be their downfall, as traditional knowledge is lost and sacred sites are forgotten. A century ago almost every village in southwestern Nigeria had a sacred grove, says Onyekwelu. Today most of the groves have shrunk to very small areas or abandoned. He believes that state backing or tourism are the most likely ways to halt the loss.
The Osun Sacred Forest, one of the last remaining primary high forests in southern Nigeria, contains statues to deities, like this one honoring Osun, the Yoruba fertility goddess.UNESCO
The latter certainly worked for a network of monkey sanctuaries in Ghana. The Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in central Ghana was originally protected in the 1820s, after a traditional fetish priest declared that its African colobus and Lowes mona monkeys were children of a local spirit. It survived in secret through the colonial era and grew in ecological importance as surrounding forests disappeared. In the 1970s, with animist beliefs fading, some locals asked the government to give the reserve formal protection. Now it is a renowned tourist destination, with its own website and guest house.
But even in the modern world, old traditions may remain important to maintain local support for such sanctuaries, says Gordon Sarfo-Adu, a manager at Ghanas Forest Commission. It is now time to recognize the value of traditional sacred grove institutions [for] biodiversity protection, he wrote recently. But that recognition should include maintaining customary practices for tending and protecting them, and encouraging the preservation of folk knowledge and classifications of plants, rather than scientific designations, which have little meaning to the local people.
Much less is documented about sacred natural sites in the Americas than in the Old World. But they undoubtedly existed on a large scale, and some persist.
In the hills of southern Guyana, the evidence for the sacred sites of the Wapichan people is clear. They still swim in sacred creeks, climb sacred trees, and visit ancestral graves in sacred forests. In Shulinab village, tribal official Claudine La Rose described to this author in 2015 how these places had been preserved in the face of opposition from Jesuit missionaries, and explained their continued importance. The elders told us about the sacred sites and the spirit grandfathers that preside over natural resources, she said, how if you cut down certain trees in the forest you will get sick and die, punished by the spirits.
The arrival of Europeans in the Americas destroyed many sacred sites and wiped out much of the traditional knowledge they enshrined. 
In the Ecuadorean Andes, sacred cloud forests protect the threatened Andean condor. While in neighboring Peru, a proposed spiritual park on land sacred to the Qeros people is home to pumas, vicunas, and distinctive forests of Polyepsis, a member of the rose family that is believed to be the highest-elevation flowering tree on Earth.
The arrival of Europeans destroyed many such sites and wiped out much of the traditional knowledge they enshrined. But African slaves shipped by the Europeans sometimes brought their own traditions that survive to this day.

In the United States, the Menominee people of Wisconsin have practiced a sophisticated system of sustainable logging for more than 150 years in the forest that makes up most of their reservation. The rules are tied to cultural principles and spiritual values derived from the desire to protect the forest habitat of the five animals that feature in the tribes creation story and represent its five clans the wolf, bear, eagle, moose, and crane. 
Modern silviculturists and forest ecologists regularly make pilgrimages to the Menominee reservation to find out how they do it. But the answer is at root as much spiritual as technical.

These facilities are strategically located near Dochula Pass with its sacred memorial shrines, Trongsa's rugged landscape, Dagana, and the deserted Education City initiative. They are believed to have begun operations around 2020 and are equipped with sophisticated mining units directly linked to hydroelectric plants.
The Himalayan kingdom is currently grappling with economic challenges, including a drop in tourism and high youth unemployment rates. Furthermore, the nation is experiencing a brain drain due to increased emigration rates. In response to these pressures, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck has championed cryptocurrency mining initiatives similar to those in El Salvador. Bhutan's hydroelectric power, which was predominantly exported to India, is now fueling these energy-intensive operations. Consequently, the nation's electricity imports have surged to $20.7 million this year.
The strategic placement of these mining centers across remote areas indicates Bhutan's substantial investment in cryptocurrency as a means of economic support. This move is part of a broader trend as countries with abundant renewable energy resources explore digital currencies to bolster their economies. The king's initiative reflects a strategic pivot as Bhutan adapts to global economic shifts while seeking new avenues for financial stability.

Madrid, Spain
General view of the city hall of Madrid.
Theres probably no city in the world having as much of a moment as Madrid. The nightlife goes until plenty of people back in the U.S. would be heading into the office, and theres nothing quite like seeing revelers of all ages clustered around fast food joints on the Gran Via at 5 in the morning attempting to prevent hangovers with a little grease. But this grand city isnt just fun, it also has some of the worlds best museums, from big players like the Prado and Thyssen, to smaller gems like the Museo Sorolla, Museo Cerralbo, and the over the top Palacio Linares. The city also boasts a handful of new hotels, from the swanky Rosewood Villa Magna brushing up against preppy Barrio Salamanca, and the EDITION in the citys historic center. William OConnor
Aran Islands, Ireland
Inis Mor, Aran Islands, Ireland.
I dont believe in magic or magic spells, which is a shame, because magic would be such an easy way to explain the pull of the Aran Islands. Bestriding the mouth of Galway Bay on the west coast of Ireland, the three Aran Islands (the largest is smaller than Manhattan) are outsized in their appeal, having drawn pilgrims both sacred and secular to their rocky shores for millenia. There are enormous stone constructions on the islands that are so old no one can remember what their original purpose was. There is now also glamping and decent cell service. But if the mix of ancient ruins and modern convenience seems fairly evenly balanced, that still doesnt entirely explain why people ferry out to these windswept islands by the thousands every year. Shorn and carved by glaciers, the land is rocky and unforested. It is not conventionally pretty. Its beauty is more rugged, and hard to convey to anyone whos never been there. Tim Robinson, who penned two of the best books ever written about the place, got close with this statement: If Ireland is intriguing as being an island off the west of Europe, then Aran, as an island off the west of Ireland, is still more so: it is Ireland raised to the power of two.

I dont know if Ill ever have the opportunity to visit Nigeria, but if I did, I would be remiss not to visit Lagosand geek out on its rock music scene. Ive been fascinated by Nigerian rock for the past decade or so, ever since I first heard William Onyeabors 1979 LP, Tomorrowwhich led me down a rabbit hole of compilations like Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970's Funky Lagos, and Nigeria Rock Special (Psychedelic Afro-Rock And Fuzz Funk In 1970s Nigeria. These records are prototypes for a unique blend of rhythm and melody that would later be explored by artists like Prince, Beck, and even Talking Heads. Lagos is also the birthplace of Fela Kutis Afrobeat, and is still a hotspot for electronic music, rock and heavy metal. Anthony Fisher
Belo Horizonte, Brazil
Mangabeiras, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. 
This mid-size Brazilian city is often overlooked by visitors coming to this expansive country, but thats their loss. The architecture in this walkable metropolis is altogether funky, because postmodern architects were encouraged to go buck-wild with their shapes and forms while covering everything in a many-hued array of square mosaic tiles. Its a city with one of the worlds liveliest bar cultures, and a cuisine heavy on the, well, heavy. The weather is good year round, so theres no wrong time to go, and its also an excellent jumping off point for excursions to Pampulha, the complex of casino, church, yacht club, and more designed by Oscar Niemeyer around an artificial lake; Inhotim, one of the largest contemporary art museums in Brazil; and Ouro Preto, the postcard-perfect preserved gold rush city. For those seeking a chic stay, the Fasano is a cant miss. William OConnor
Osaka, Japan

Japan is finally open again and so its time for some post-COVID hedonism. Tokyo has the buzz and Kyoto has the history, but Osaka is where you can engage in some good old-fashioned gluttony. This sprawling metropolisthe second-largest city in Japanis so fabled to be a food-and-drink town that its unofficial slogan is kuidaore, meaning eat yourself bankrupt, or more to the point: Eat til you drop. One could easily spend both day and night cozying up next to the chatty locals at Osakas many taverns and standing-only pubs, gorging on local specialties like takoyaki (octopus balls), okonomiyaki (savory grilled pancakes), or kitsune udon (thick noodles topped with fried tofu). Dont want to eat yourself into financial ruin? Osaka is also the perfect home base for day trips to visit the humbling history of Hiroshima, the shrines and temples of Miyajima, the sacred deer of Nara, or neighboring cultural paradise Kyoto.

Rincón, Puerto Rico
A man paddle boards off the coast of Rincon, Puerto Rico. 
When most vacation to Puerto Rico, they find themselves adventuring around the capital city of San Juan. But just a couple hours west lies the sun soaked city of Rincón. This island town is best known for its stunning beaches, incredible surf, and breathtaking sunsets. But Rincón has so much more to offer, being a perfect winter-time escape to a warmer climate with the surf near Domes Beach (an old nuclear reactor turned history museum) reaching up to 20 foot swells in the winter time. That also is the best time of year to view some humpback whales or book a beach-side horseback ride during the picturesque sunsets. Rincón is a perfect getaway for those who dont have a passport or dont want to have to deal with currency exchange as it is part of a U.S. territory. Reid Webb
Kansas City, Missouri
Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen's 'Shuttlecocks' sculpture sits outside the Nelson-Atkins Museum Of Art in Kansas City.
Nearly every American hopes to do a cross-country road trip at some point, and it can be tough to figure out which route is the best. While every one has its selling points, any that includes this heartland city will be a success. Cruise around its ritzy neighborhoods and ogle some of the countrys best Gilded Age architecture, gobble up its famed BBQ, visit the Nelson-Atkins, one of the best art museums in the world, or go a little kooky with the unforgettable The National Museum of Toys and Miniatures. The Crossroads Hotel is always the place to stay, and its rooftop bar is very much the spot to be. For those looking to carbo-load, 1900 Barker in nearby Lawrence cant be beat. And history buffs should feel giddy: the recently renovated Truman Library is fantastic and the nearby Vail Mansion is filled with weird stories. William OConnor
Catania, Sicily

Catania is Sicilys second-largest city, home to its oldest university (dating back to 1434), situated on the islands east coast, facing directly across the Mediterranean toward southern Greece. And while you cant avoid the ancient history of the place, its a thoroughly modern, walkable town of ocean breezes, fresh fish, and volcanic ash from nearby Mt. Etna. From the all-too-brief time I spent in Catania, my favorite memories are of walking through the San Barillo district. In less than a ten minute walk in any direction, I climbed to the top of the 18th century Roman Catholic abbey, the Badia di Sant'Agata, with outrageous panoramic views of the city and the sea. That was followed by some vinyl record shopping at the tiny but well-stocked Cari &amp; Rari, and concluded with some ridiculously good pizza and cannoli at Il Vicolo Pizze e Vinolocated a few feet from the stunningly well-preserved ruins of a Roman amphitheater dating back to around the second century A.D.

Bangkok, Thailand
People eat at a street food market in Bangkok's Chinatown on September 16, 2020. 
The clock is ticking on the full return of Chinese tourists, as the government in Beijing slowly lifts its COVID restrictions. That also means the clock is ticking on experiencing Southeast Asia without massive crowds. Before the pandemic, Bangkok was the worlds most visited city, and Chinese tourists played a major role in that. Right now, you can experience its famed golden palaces and temples with a fraction of the tourists you might have pre-pandemic. (Dont get us wrong, its still crowded.) Regardless of crowds, though, any visit to Bangkok is great for those with an appetite as its legendary street food will make you reluctant to ever sit down in an actual restaurant. Classic hotels like the Art Deco and The Siam are always a good bet, but The Standard recently opened a lively new hotel in the citys tallest tower. If youre looking to take a break from Thai food, Ojo Bangkok at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful spaces weve come across in recent years, and the Mexican food it serves matches the quality of the decor.William OConnor
Monument Valley
West and East Mitten Buttes in Monument Valley, Utah. 
Its embarrassing how much the movies and TV have shaped my travel history (who else goes to San Francisco, at least in part, to see where Brigid OShaughnessy shot Miles Archer in The Maltese Falcon?). My wife once arranged a very successful vacationcomplete with (unscripted) runaway horsearound my fascination with Monument Valley, born of watching way too many John Ford movies (ok, no such thing as way too many Ford movies, but let that pass). My first visit to Malibu was practically levitational after my host pointed out that we were dining in the beachside restaurant where Rockford took prospective clients in The Rockford Files, and Rockfords trailer would have been situated just across the parking lot. Which kinda sorta explains, more than I care to admit, why I want to go to Amsterdam: because I saw this cool hotel in Oceans 12 and thought, ok, legal weed and Old Masters will get me there, but I have to admit, seeing this hotel in that movie is whats selling me. Hotel Amsterdam, by the way. Malcolm Jones
Aarhus, Denmark
""Den Gamle By Folk Museum in Aarhus, Denmark.
Denmarks second-largest city has it all: a diverse and booming food scene emphasizing sustainability and playfulness; a world-class art museum with an iconic rooftop display; awe-inspiring architecture spanning from Gothic to modernist to neo-futurist; and a central quarter lining a gorgeous canal, jam-packed with coffee houses, shops, restaurants, and public art. The surrounding region features a long list of nature walks, historic manors, thought-provoking works of public art, organic villages, and oddball curiosities like a full-scale Graceland replica. As we wrote earlier this year, Aarhus is truly skidegodt, or, cool as shit.Just a three-and-a-half hour train or car ride from Copenhagen, a trip to Aarhus is incredibly easy to pair with the Danish capital for a getaway we assure you wont forget.

Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt
People relax on beach chairs at a beach popular with tourists in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm El Sheikh, 
It might have been in the news more than usual of late because of the recent climate conference, but as a tourist destination for Americans, Sharm often gets short shrift. Thats why it was a recent selection for our series on underrated destinations, Its Still a Big World. As Cassandra Brooklyn noted in her piece, the beaches were beautiful (and uncrowded), the people were friendly, the food was fantastic, and the scuba diving was phenomenal There are great parties, bars, beaches, and water-based activities, but theres also easy access to charming smaller towns and significant archeological sites. Oh, and the city has the worlds biggest Four Seasons, and it just added a sumptuous new complex of villas and rooms. William OConnor

When Bhutan reopened to the world in September, one of the last to do so, it did so with a bit of newsthe daily fee for being in the country was raised to $200. Long seen as one of the worlds most exclusive destinations, the sole carbon-negative country in the world is trying to ensure that remains the case. While the journey to this Himalayan kingdom can be arduous, the payoff is huge as youll experience beautiful monastery fortresses without jostling for space, and hike up mountains blanketed in rhododendron forests often without passing a single soul except for a guard dog. The country also boasts some of the worlds most luxurious hotels, including one of our favorites worldwide, Gangtey Lodge. William OConnor

If you find yourself in Barcelona, make time for a long weekend 50 miles northeast in Girona, a gorgeous medieval city that has long been Catalonias most underrated. Get lost in the citys Old Quarter with its well-preserved Jewish quarter, baroque architecture, and maze-like cobblestone streets. Stop in for light lunches and coffee at cafés like La Fábrica, a laid-back cyclist haven. Stroll along the banks of the Onyar river and gaze upon the rows of picturesque homes with immaculately curated color facades. Try your damnedest to get a table at El Celler de Can Roca, the Michelin three-starred restaurant inheriting El Bullis legacy as the regions crown jewel. And make sure to take a day trip out to Cadaqués, the hilly seaside town with whitewashed homes and top-notch seafood, beloved by both Anthony Bourdain and Salvador Dalí, who lived there for much of his life.

We recommend making a home base out of the small town of Escalante, more specifically Yonder Escalante, a simple but elegant glamping resort located along Scenic Byway 12. Drive along the route, including the thrilling Hogsback stretch of road, hike Bryces Queens/Navajo combo loop, scale the hoodoo-and-arches playground at Devils Garden, or just kick back at Yonder for a day of poolside vibes and a night of fireside grilling and stargazing.

Asheville, North Carolina
Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. 
As a native of the South, I'm ashamed to admit I haven't explored much of the region outside of my native Louisiana and the nearby states of Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi. Next year, I'm making it a point to visit cities in the Upper South starting with Asheville. Nestled between the Great Smoky Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains, Asheville is an outdoor lover's dream. There are many hiking and biking trails to traverse, and a scenic drive along Blue Ridge Parkway, aka, America's Favorite Drive, is sure to impress with its stunning vistas and close-up views of the rugged mountains. While the mountain city has mostly been able to keep its rich architectural legacy intact (The Biltmore Estatebuilt between 1889 and 1895 remains America's Largest Home at 175,000 square feet!), it has also made room for unconventional architecture that fits within its Appalachian landscape. Earlier this fall, an urban cabin campground opened on the west side of the city. Situated just along the French Broad River Greenway, the Wrong Way River Lodge and Cabins feature 16 standalone A-frame cabins that are Scappalachian in designmerging Scandinavian design with the mountain aesthetic of the Appalachians.

Draped across the very top of the Indian subcontinent, the Himalayas are the stuff of trekking legend. Every hiker worth their boots has likely dreamed of tackling this ranges trails, which carve out the craggy routes between remote villages and mountain monasteries, in the formidable shadows of the worlds highest peaks.
In the high-altitude valleys of Nepal, Bhutan and India, trekkers face sights that many may believe are reserved for mountaineers: the aquamarine lakes in their valleys, the alpine meadows dusted with wildflowers and the snow-capped mountains themselves. 
And in the rugged landscapes between the peaks live bands of indomitable people nomadic yak herders, enlightenment-seeking monks, mountain-climbing Sherpas. Youll find culture in abundance here, too, whether you stay in local teahouses or trek off-grid. And there are ways for even beginners to experience all of this.
The reality is that with so many destinations to choose from, trekking in the Himalayas can be as challenging or as comfortable as travellers want it to be. On a camping expedition in Bhutan, supported by guides, cooks, tent-assemblers and even packhorses, trekkers are largely unburdened save for perhaps a camera or hiking poles. Meanwhile, at the opposite end, prize views are open to anyone looking for a real challenge and willing to do all the heavy lifting. Hardy trekkers can find the kind of solitude normally reserved for snow leopards in remote valleys, where the only sound comes from tinkling streams of meltwater and the soft breezes that drift down from the high mountains in whispers. 
To help you make sense of the region, choose between two long-distance treks in Nepal or Bhutan, which are suitable for fit beginner or intermediate hikers, or try an easier introduction to the Himalayan foothills of India in search of rare birdlife.
Itinerary one: Everest Base Camp, Nepal
There are 14 peaks higher than 8,000m in the world, and eight of them are found in Nepal including Mount Everest (Sagarmatha), which, at 8,849m, is the loftiest of them all. The two-week trek to Everest Base Camp takes breathless walkers to heights above 5,000m, with thrilling views every step of the way. 
Highlights
1. Namche BazaarIt takes two days to hike from the tiny mountain airstrip at Lukla to Namche Bazaar. This thriving amphitheatre of stone lodges gazes towards the lofty peaks, with ancient shrines, Gore-Tex gear shops, yak steak restaurants and even an Irish bar, where trekkers toast to their success after tiring days on the trails. Pause here for short acclimatisation hikes to the fascinating Sherpa villages of Khumjung, Khunde and Thame, where you can get a taste of local life.
2. Ama Dablam Everest may be top dog, but 6,812m-high Ama Dablam is arguably the most perfect peak in the central Himalayas an isolated sentinel almost mirroring the pyramid-topped Buddhist stupas that line the Base Camp trail. There are stupendous views of the snow-encrusted summit between Namche Bazaar and the Buddhist monastery at Tengboche.
3. TengbocheThe Buddhist monastery at Tengboche holds a special place in the hearts of visitors to the Himalayas. The resident monks have welcomed everyone from Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the first to conquer Everest in 1953, to record-breaking Nepali climber Nirmal Purja. Millions of trekkers have also been drawn by its traditional architecture and vividly colourful murals. Its one of the loveliest stops in the Everest region, with epic views over a ridge of snowy peaks and comfy lodges crowning a grassy plateau. 
4. Everest Base CampThe base camp used for ascents of Mount Everest is perhaps the most legendary trekking destination of them all. Amid scattered boulders and tooth-like pinnacles of ice, youll find mountaineers huddled around dome tents and satellite phones, acclimatising for the push to the summit. Grab a slice of hot apple pie from the worlds highest bakery before trekking downhill to the teahouses at Gorak Shep. 
5. Kala PattharThe summit of Everest is hidden from view at Base Camp, behind the rocky shoulder of 7,861m-tall Nuptse. For incredible vistas of the worlds highest peak, hike from Gorak Shep to the summit of Kala Patthar (5,645m) a blackened crag with uninterrupted Everest views. Its a breathless two-hour ascent to reach the top, but from here, the black summit of Everest stands clear of its companion peaks, rising majestically above the Khumbu Glacier.
Itinerary two: Jhomolhari, Bhutan
The Jhomolhari trek is to Bhutan what the Everest Base Camp trek is to Nepal. Rising through wind-scoured valleys, this week-long camping trek takes its name from 7,326m Jhomolhari, the sacred mountain abode of one of Bhutans five protector goddesses and the defining landmark on the route.
Highlights
1. Taktshang Goemba According to legend, Taktshang Goemba aka the Tigers Nest was anchored to the side of a sheer cliff wall using the hair of angels. Perhaps Bhutans most famous monastery, here pilgrims chant mantras, prayer flags dance in the Himalayan breeze and prayer halls are adorned with legions of Buddhas and bodhisattvas (enlightened beings). The steep four-hour hike here from Paro is a perfect primer for the more ambitious climbs that await on the Jhomolhari trek. 
2. Drukgyel DzongThis ancient dzong (fortress) set high on a hill is en route to the starting point of the Jhomolhari trek, Sharna Zampa, and many trekkers still pause here to admire the view before lacing up their hiking boots for the main event. After a devastating fire in 1951, the ornate prayer halls and woodcarvings of the historic fortress are being restored using traditional Himalayan construction techniques that have been preserved through the centuries. 
3. Jangothang Reached via a two-day trek from Sharna Zampa, the campground at Jangothang sits around 750m below the highest point on the trail, with Jhomolharis summit rising at the end of the valley. Linger here for gentle acclimatisation hikes to higher viewpoints, turquoise lakes and the ruined fortress that once guarded traders moving between Bhutan and Tibet. 
4. Lingzhi The village of Lingzhi sprawls across a grassy valley speckled with yaks and wildflowers, with the face of Jhomolhari peering over its shoulder. This mountain outpost is dominated by a timeworn hilltop dzong, built to commemorate Bhutans victory over Tibet in 1667. Its a soothing spot to rest or explore before the big push to the Yeli La.
5. Yeli LaMarked by a lonely cairn decked with prayer flags, and offering sweeping views over a rugged landscape, the highest point on the trek sits at 4,820m its barely a small hill compared to the surrounding peaks, but still a draining endeavour at high altitude. Keep your eyes peeled for Himalayan blue sheep and marmots while you make the long descent onwards into the Wang Chhu valley towards Thimphu and your end point. 
(A practical guide to hiking the Himalayas.)
Getting thereThere are no direct flights to Nepal; the easiest connections are through Istanbul with Turkish Airlines or through Doha with Qatar Airways. Turkish Airlines has daily flights to Istanbul from numerous UK airports; Qatar Airways flies daily to Doha from London, Manchester and Edinburgh. Many airlines fly from Kathmandu to the starting point, Lukla, including Yeti Airlines.Drukair and Bhutan Airlines fly to Bhutans Paro International Airport from Delhi, Kolkata, Kathmandu, Bangkok and Singapore. Numerous airlines offer connections. The Jhomolhari trek starts 10 miles north of Paro at Sharna Zampa your tour agent will arrange transfers. 
How to do it Intrepid has 15-day guided treks to Everest Base Camp in Nepal from £1,043 per person. Flights to Kathmandu not included. 
The Adventure People has 12-day treks along the Jhomolhari trek from £4,805 per person, starting and finishing in Paro. Packages include meals, tented accommodation, guides and hotels in Paro. Visas and flights to Paro extra.

Holly Walters, CC BY-SA
For more than 2,000 years, Hinduism, Buddhism and the shamanic Himalayan religion of Bon have venerated Shaligrams – ancient fossils of ammonites, a class of extinct sea creatures related to modern squids.

Originating from a single remote region in northern Nepal – the Kali Gandaki River Valley of Mustang – Shaligram stones are viewed primarily as manifestations of the Hindu god Vishnu. Because they are not human-made, but created by the landscape, they are believed to have an intrinsic consciousness of their own. As a result, Shaligrams are kept in homes and in temples, where they are treated as both living gods and active community members.

I went on my first Shaligram pilgrimage in 2015. After arriving at the village of Jomsom in Mustang, I, along with a group of Indian and Nepali pilgrims, started the five-day trek northeast from there to the temple of Muktinath, where the journey culminates. 

Making our way through the winding river passage, between 26,000-foot (8,000-meter) mountain peaks, we carefully looked for Shaligrams in the fast-moving water and gathered up any we could reach.

Since then, as an anthropologist, I have documented a wide variety of Shaligram practices while working with devotees in Nepal and in India. In 2020 I wrote the first ethnographic account, “Shaligram Pilgrimage in the Nepal Himalayas,” which demonstrates how popular and important the pilgrimage is among South Asian and the wider global Hindu diasporas.

However, my ongoing work focuses more on how climate change and gravel mining are altering the course of the river, which is endangering the pilgrimage by making it harder to find Shaligrams.

Living fossils

The mythology of Shaligrams is associated with two legends. The first is told in a series of three Hindu scriptures, the Varaha, Padma and Brahmavaivarta Puranas. 

In each version of this story, the Hindu god Vishnu, believed to be the supreme creator, is cursed by the goddess Tulsi, who is also called Brinda, because he compromises her chastity. As the story is told, Vishnu disguised himself as her husband Jalandhar so that the god Shiva could kill the demon in a fight. This was because Jalandhar, born from Shiva’s third eye, had previously won a boon from the god Brahma that his wife’s chastity would keep him invincible in any battle. 

Angry at the deception, Tulsi transformed herself into a river – the Kali Gandaki – and turned Vishnu into a river stone, a Shaligram. In this way, Vishnu would be continuously born from her, like a child, in repayment for the karmic debt of killing her husband and making her a widow. The landscape of Mustang thus represents the bodies of Tulsi and Vishnu, producing Shaligram stones as divine manifestations from the waters of the Kali Gandaki. 

The second legend is told in the Skanda Purana, which explains that Shaligrams are physically created by a type of celestial worm called the vajra-kita – translated as thunderbolt or adamantine worm – which is responsible for carving out the holes and coiled spiral formations that appear on the stones. 

As a result, the beliefs around the mythological formation of Shaligrams involve both legends. As part of the first legend, Vishnu takes up residence within a sacred stone that appears in the Kali Gandaki River of Nepal. The story of the second legend is expressed in the carving of that stone by the vajra-kita to give it its uniquely smooth, rounded shape and the characteristic spirals both inside and on the surface. 

Rivers and roads

Shaligram pilgrimage takes place high in the Himalayas, usually between April and June and again between late August and November. This helps avoid both the worst of the July monsoon rains and the December snows.

Mustang, however, is currently divided into the upper or the northern region and the lower or the southern region. In 1950, both Upper and Lower Mustang were closed to travel following China’s annexation of Tibet. But though Lower Mustang was reopened to pilgrimage and trekking in 1992, Upper Mustang remains highly restricted. 

This means that the current Shaligram pilgrimage route does not include visiting the Damodar Kund – the glacial lake that produces Shaligrams from the high-altitude fossil beds – because pilgrims are still not allowed to freely cross into Upper Mustang.

The village of Kagbeni marks the principal boundary between the two divisions and is also one of the main stops on the Shaligram pilgrimage route. The village sits directly on the banks of the Kali Gandaki and is one of the few areas where pilgrims can reliably find significant numbers of Shaligrams by wading through the river themselves and by watching the river bed for any signs of a black spiral emerging from the sand.

The last destination on the pilgrimage route, at roughly 13,000 feet (4,000 meters), is the temple site of Muktinath, which contains multiple sacred areas of worship for Hindus, Buddhists and followers of Bon. As a place of Hindu worship, Muktinath offers a central shrine to the deity Vishnu as well as 108 water spouts under which pilgrims must pass. The water spouts themselves are hammered directly into the mountain side, which contains a natural aquifer, and provide one last opportunity for practitioners to bathe themselves and their Shaligrams in the waters of Mustang.

As a Bon sanctuary, Muktinath is home to the “Jwala Mai,” or the mother flame, a natural gas vent that produces a continuous flame that burns next to the constant flow of water from the mountain aquifer. Along with the high winds of the Himalayas, representing the element of air, and Shaligrams, representing the element of stone, Jwala Mai contributes to Bon practitioners’ view of Muktinath as a rare place where all of the sacred elements of their religion come together.

As a Buddhist complex, Muktinath is more commonly referred to as “Chumig-Gyatsa,” or the Hundred Waters, and the icon that is worshipped by Hindus as Vishnu is venerated by Buddhists as Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. In 2016, Muktinath also became home to the largest statue of the Buddha ever built in Nepal.

Climate change and Shaligrams

These traditions then come together to provide a place to ritually welcome all of the new Shaligrams that have just been taken from the water into the lives of the people who venerate them. But Shaligrams are becoming rarer.

Climate change, faster glacial melting, and gravel mining in the Kali Gandaki are changing the course of the river, which means fewer Shaligrams are appearing each year. This is mainly because the Kali Gandaki is fed by meltwater from the Southern Tibetan Plateau. But with the glacier disappearing, the river is becoming smaller and shifting away from the fossil beds that contain the ammonites needed to become Shaligrams.

For the moment, though, the majority of pilgrims are still able to find at least a few Shaligrams every time they travel to Mustang, but it’s getting harder. Even so, once the new Shaligrams are introduced to worship at Muktinath, it is time for pilgrims to leave Mustang and return home. 

For many, this is a bittersweet moment that marks the birth of their new household deities into the family but also means that they will be leaving the beauty of the high Himalayas and the place where deities come to Earth. 

But all the pilgrims, me included, look forward to the days when we can return to walk the pilgrimage paths again, hopeful that Shaligrams will still appear.

Er. P.L Khushu
The G20 Working Group meeting in Srinagar concluded peacefully, with a voluminous applause all over the world. It has shown to world that the people of Jammu and Kashmir want peace and through the means of development want to grow and prosper both economically and socially. The element of hate and fanaticism brought in by certain elements is not their object and subject. They want to live peacefully like other fellow citizens of India. It should go as a testament and a warning signal to the silent abettors of terror and hate who both subjectively and objectively, have been adding fuel to this fire of terror, for their inherent stupid intents of remaining in power perpetually, cynically behaving as monarchs of Jammu and Kashmir, claiming it as their hereditary monarchial empire. However, it has been shaken now. They have been shown the door. The Mayor of Srinagar Junaid Mattu tweeted “The successful culmination of the Third Tourism Working Group (TWG) meeting of the G20 in Srinagar with the participation of nearly 60 foreign delegates is a tribute to the people of Srinagar and their spirit of hospitality. G 20 working group tourism meet in Srinagar, should serve them with a warning that enough is enough and go and weep in your own dens of disdain about the imperpetual status of their toxic views, which kept the development of Jammu and Kashmir on the broil for decades.The G20 or Group of 20 is an intergovernmental forum comprising of 19 countries and the European Union (EU). It works to address major issues related to the global economy, such as international financial stability, climate change mitigation, and sustainable development. The G20 is composed of most of the world’s largest economies finance ministries, including both industrialized and developing nations; it accounts for around 80% of gross world product (GWP), 75% of international trade, two-thirds of the global population, and 60% of the world’s land area. India is holding presidency of G20, since 1st, December 2022, with its presidency’s theme being “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”, or “One Earth One Family One Future”.On this occasion, the Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said the exporters of terror, a reference towards Pakistan, have been taken aback with the success of G20 meeting in Srinagar and maintained that displeasure of the neighbor won’t make any difference, because the people of Jammu and Kashmir are sick and tired of their nefarious designs.He said that all major G20 nations supported the idea of holding an international event in Jammu and Kashmir and naturally this event of such a magnitude is organized in J&amp;K, when some people were bound to have problems with it. Describing presidency of G20 as a matter of pride for India, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi ensured that all regions get due representation while deciding venues of the meetings. Pakistan made threatening statements, which are not acceptable to any peace-loving nation. But their displeasure is not going to make any difference as the people of Jammu and Kashmir are sick and tired of their nefarious designs, he said. Taking a dig at Pakistan, the Lieutenant Governor said their first worry should be about the situation in their own troubled country instead of interfering in our internal matters. Asserting that situation in Jammu and Kashmir during last three years has changed a lot; he said that the people have contributed to this as they don’t want replication of the past situation when educational institutions and shops would remain shut. Now Jammu and Kashmir has moved on and so have our people. They just want peace, normalcy, development and prosperity which they are experiencing now.It needs to be mentioned here that Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto had issued threats to disrupt G20 meeting in Srinagar. The hosting of the event, despite opposition from China and Pakistan, is certainly an indication of changed Kashmir, which has now evolved towards “peace and prosperity”. People have left violence and negativity behind, when the stone pelting and major terror incidents have become history of past. Normalcy has returned to the beautiful Jammu and Kashmir.Around 57 foreign dignitaries from 27 countries and over 100 delegates from union ministries and other organizations from Delhi were part of the meeting held in the picturesque Sher e Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) on the Boulevard Road built on Dal Lake. The dignitaries released a draft for the national strategy on film tourism as the Ministry of Tourism signed MoUs with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (FICCI) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) for film tourism promotion in the country. Throughout the event, the officials and delegates promoted Kashmir as a major tourist destination in India and called for further exploration. The G20-related event was one of the most high profile programs organized in Srinagar in years despite security challenges, especially in the aftermath of the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A in August 2019.Hosting an international event like the G-20 tourism group summit has put Jammu and Kashmir in the global spotlight. It manifests Jammu and Kashmir’s potential as a tourist destination. It can prompt foreign tourists, investors, and travel agencies, to see Jammu and Kashmir as an international tourist destination. The summit has helped to promote Jammu and Kashmir as a safe and attractive tourist destination. The presence of delegates from G-20 countries highlights the region’s natural beauty, cultural heritage, and tourism opportunities. This exposure will lead to an increase in tourist arrivals, both domestic and international. The Government’s focus on world-class tourism infrastructure, including discussions on 100 percent foreign direct investment, indicates a commitment to enhancing the tourism sector in Jammu and Kashmir. Investments in infrastructure development can improve transportation, accommodation, and other facilities, creating a more appealing and comfortable environment for tourists.Jammu and Kashmir is a picture of peace, as the days of fear have gone. Just last year two crore tourists visited Kashmir, which is an indication that the people have fully endorsed the policies and programmes of Narendra Modi government aimed at peace, development and welfare of masses.G20 meeting in Srinagar, has not only been a key in promoting tourism of the union territory but may also expose the propaganda of Pakistan and China in post abrogation of Article 370. It has shown the actual position of Kashmir to rest of the world. In 2019 when Article 370 was abrogated Pakistan took it as an opportunity to defame India, so raised the issue in various forums but could not muster enough support from any country/organization to pressurize India.Not only Pakistan who is the web and the base of terror in Kashmir for so many years and is using it as a proxy war against India is responsible for unrest and war like situations in Kashmir, the home grown abettors of this terror are equally responsible for the devastation of Kashmir through terror. The other dangerous silent abettors of this terror, who in the name of asking for special status to Jammu and Kashmir, have equally destroyed Kashmir for remaining in power permanently as dynasty based politicians. They have been more dangerous in this regard to exploit Jammu and Kashmir for their personal benefits and interest, with a dynastic base. Sometimes such people would ask for talking to Pakistan for peace in Kashmir, when sometimes they would threaten to approach China in this regard. Such like entities have made unholy alliances like Gupkar Alliance, which is now being called as Gupkar Gang. In fact they have left no stone unturned to keep Jammu and Kashmir unstable perpetually for their personal interests to remain in power. They are the worst enemies of the people of Jammu and Kashmir in this regard. They want to keep things boiling. They opposed abrogation of Article 370 and 35 A, because it provided them an ample opportunity to rob the state exchequer for their personal benefits. This expo of G20 global meet in Kashmir has dashed their hopes of further exploitation of Jammu and Kashmir for their personal benefits.A distinguished member of this gang raised the question why G-20 meet is scheduled for Kashmir and Ladakh only and not for Jammu? It was again a ploy to create unease within the two regions of Jammu and Kashmir, when such people have been the worst enemies about the growth of Jammu region in the past while being in governance. He forgot to admit not in ignorance but for chaos, that the proposed meeting is specifically meant to promote tourism in G-20 countries. Kashmir is a world-renowned tourist destination. Millions of Kashmiris are connected with the industry. PM wants Kashmir to be high on international tourism map.Secondly, Kashmir Valley was the main target of insurgency and separation movements jointly sponsored by Pakistan in collaboration with its Jihadis among some of the majority community in Kashmir Valley. It had to be shown to the external world that Kashmir has developed during the terrorism as well, when the terror in Kashmir, is subject of past now in Kashmir. Thirdly, India wants the world to know that there is development by leaps and bounds in Kashmir in post-370 and 35-A era. That is the way how misguided people have been be won over.The summit will market Kashmir globally and thereby will increase employment and income of the Union Territory. It can make a good market for Kashmiri handicrafts, cuisines, winter sports etc. The effect on its economy will be multi fold if we can get more visitors from the developed countries. Today’s Jammu Kashmir is not a land of civil curfews or stone palters. It is a land of peace and prosperity that responsible and responsive administration is trying too hard to bring in the people’s lives.As the event concluded, the delegates from member countries visited several spots in Srinagar city, including the famous Mughal gardens, Royal Springs Golf Course and the newly revamped Polo View market in the Lal Chowk area, where the visitors also shopped for Kashmir’s arte facts.With the holding of the G20 meet in Srinagar, the tourism sector of the Kashmir valley is bound to get a big and a marginal flip, which is very good for the overall welfare of the people of Kashmir in particular. Similarly Jammu has a tremendous potential for tourism development and has abundant charming tourist’s spots which could be exploited for the development. But Jammu was repeatedly ignored in this sector of development too, claiming that only Kashmir valley qualified for it, because of its natural scenic beauty. Just a max factor has been added to Jammu in this regard like Patnitop tourist spot, Mansar Lake, etc, when huge funds under central government schemes for tourism were utilized only in Kashmir mostly.While coming to actual tourism potential in Jammu division , If Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Sonamarg are considered as heavens on earth, as for as Kashmir Valley is concerned, Bhadarwah valley is no lesser a paradise as for as Jammu region is concerned.Bhaderwah is a lovely cool valley as the valley of Kashmir is. Its perpetual natural beauty and scenic status has made it to be called as ‘Chota Kashmir’. This Splendid Springing Valley is a beautiful valley situated at a distance of about 200 km from Jammu. If developed to the standard rationale of appropriate tourism standards, it can easily invite the foreign tourists in abundance, particularly for adventure tourism. It has enough potential to cater for the recreational tourism for the domestic and local tourists as well.The notable places for tourism development in Bhaderwah are Chinta Valley, Padri, Jai Valley, Seoj Meadow, Bhal Padri etc. Chinta Valley is situated 6500 ft above sea level is a picturesque valley in Bhaderwah bounded by thick coniferous forests. The valley is surrounded by several tourist spots including Thuba which is located across the Chinta Nallah. It is superb location for adventure tourism as also recreational tourism. Padri have beautiful landscapes and lies on the ensuing Bhaderwah-Chamba road at a distance of about 40 Kms from Bhadarwah. The landscape runs in a vast area when it is an ideal location for adventure sports like Snow-skiing in winters and Paragliding in summers. It is also highest Pass on Bhadarwah Chamba road. Jai is a green Valley which lies on the North East of Bhadarwah town about 32 Kms. away connected to the town by beautiful Bhadarwah-Jai Link Road. This Valley has a large area under its command when a river known Jai River divides it in two meadows.This Jai Nallah is popular for Trout Fish Culture. It is the ideal place for winter sports and trekking in the cool blue waters of this mountainous location. Seoj is flanked by a beautiful river on its west which emanates from hills surrounding Kailash Kund. The landscape across the river is replica of the beauty of Pahalgam, whereas on the eastern side there are long stretches of grasslands. On the south is the sacred Kailash Kund, surrounded by snow-capped mountains. On way to Kailash Kund, there is unique landscape at Shankh Paddar. This is just to mention a little of it about Jammu about the development of tourism in Jammu for want of space in this article. Government of day should consider on priority to boost the tourism sector in Jammu on equitable basis as that of Kashmir.(The author is a chartered consultant civil engineer, who loves his mother land the union territory of Jammu &amp; Kashmir).",,Statetimes.in,Kailash Sacred Landscape,,,0.8,0.3,"Governance, Other",Other,Other,English

Dholes, also known as Asiatic wild dogs, are one of the most endangered yet least studied carnivores in the world.
Six years ago, on a regular workday, I was sitting at my desk tagging photos from a camera trap survey. Late in the afternoon, a picture of an uncanny species baffled me. It looked somewhat like a domestic dog, but taller and longer-bodied. Most distinctively, the bushy black tail was dangling on its back. Upon consultation with one of the senior technicians, I learned that the animal was a 'dhole' (or bankukur in Nepali), a species Id never heard of.
Also known as Asiatic wild dogs, dholes are one of the apex predators of tropical and subtropical forest that roam in packs and are among the most proficient hunters of all wild carnivores. Rusty brown in color, they are swift runners but are also great swimmers and, unlike other canids, they have only two molar teeth instead of three restricting them to a pure meat diet a specialization known as hypercarnivory. Dholes are one of the most endangered yet least studied carnivores in the world.
The cryptic species in the photo compelled me to search for more information. Ironically, I could not find much. My initial unanswered questions brought more questions. Why did no one study them? Why aren't they brought-up in wildlife seminars and workshops?
A camera trap image of an adult dhole with two pups in Parsa National Park, Nepal.
The camera trap photo that mystified me was captured from Barandabhar Corridor Forest. The corridor forest is a key part of the Chitwan Annapurna Landscape as it connects the plain lands (Terai) with the hills and mountains (the Mahabharat and Chure Ranges), and shelters a plethora of biodiversity. In 2018, my colleagues and I published the camera trap record as the first evidence that dhole had been detected in the corridor forest). In 2019, I received a Fulbright scholarship to pursue my MS degree and chose wild dogs as my research species to analyze their occupancy and diet in Nepal. So, this field season, I am chasing dholes in Parsa National Park, the youngest national park in Nepal.
Today is the first day of installing camera traps for dholes. I wake up early before the sun. The wildlife technicians and I get ready and hop into the jeep. The jeep drops us to the closest road and thereafter we proceed on foot towards the target locations guided by our GPS (Global Positioning System). Our way is marked by fresh tracks of wild elephants and their dung. However, the excitement of sighting dholes shades the fear of encountering wild elephants or any other challenges.

As we walk down, the bright sun glares upon us. Dense sal forest with fallen, dried leaves color our way. Soon, we merge with a trail leading us to a creek. The creek appears dry as it is late March (it's hot and arid) and consists only of coarse sand and gravel meandering through the landscape. The sand absorbs the heat quickly and retains it longer, making the air hot and sticky. Soon, the waves of heat make our bare skin prickle. While walking at a brisk pace you dont appreciate the true sensation of the heat. But as soon as you stop, you feel it rising, stinging first in the legs, moving rapidly up to the thighs and to the face, staining the cheeks. The sweat streams from your head, running down your cheeks, nose, and all over your face, streaming into the eyes, where it burns.

We keep moving toward our targeted camera trap location both with excitement and nervousness. While walking, we fixate our eyes on the trail, checking for signs of dholes and their prey. While doing so, I wonder if a dhole might be observing me and mocking my futile effort to track it down against its furtive movements! So be it; time and again I keep inspecting my surroundings with binoculars, expecting to sight the majestic swift gait of the brown creature along the stream bed. I try not to blink my eyes out of fear of missing its glance in a single flicker. But I see nothing other than swaying elephant grass and the hills on the horizon.
Dholes are adept athletes. They are rarely glimpsed and upon sighting they can vanish into the background as if they were never there.
Suddenly, my feet and eyes stop at the same time as I see some familiar tracks in the sand. So do my team members. Yes, a dhole's track! I quickly take out a ruler, GPS, datasheet, pen, and a clipboard from my bag. Measuring the footprints with the ruler, I record data and take photos of the footprints. We find additional footprints, smaller than the last ones. We speculate that it could be an adult dhole with pups.
Following the screams of peafowl and whooping screeches of monkeys and langurs, we march forward. These are alarm calls either alerting other species about us, or warning us about the predators. Soon, we reach one of our target trails. Only after deciding the best possible angle to capture images of our focal species, we set up the camera. Like humans, animals prefer the forest trail, streams, or roads to move more easily. So, we target these natural pathways. Once the camera is deployed, I record the data in my form: longitude, latitude, habitat type, and camera model number. Some of my team members seem busy patrolling in the distance with binoculars.

We keep marching to other camera locations, accompanied by the warm breeze and with the unique smell of dried sal leaves. I wonder how the burning temperature of 38-40 degrees C (100-104 F) does not daunt me; I was born and raised in the mid-hills with its mild climate. It could be the excitement due to dholes. Or could it be my tough genes? Yes, tough genes as my mom, grandmom, great grandmom, and great-great grandmom were forest users, as well as the forest keepers since time immemorial.
I visualize the blurry past where my mother spent most of her daytime hours in the forest. Carrying a doko (basket) and a namlo (long rope that supports the doko), she went into the forest every day to collect fuel for our home and fodder for our livestock. While lopping trees for fodder, she made sure each one would spring back full of life next spring, and while thinning trees she made sure that every tree got enough space, sunlight, and water to grow into a big viable tree.
China Rayamajhi, Trishna's mother, preparing for a day of fodder collecting in the forest.
My ancestors believe that Bandevi the goddess of the forest resides in these wild places. The goddess is worshipped every year. If one harms the wild animals or smuggles the timber, they believe that the goddess gets angry and brings a bad omen to the family and the village. I link my ancestors story of safeguarding the forest with the story of dholes because both have one thing in common: both are unwritten and unheard by the world. And my quest isnt mine alone; its a shared one that starts with my ancestors.
The only thing that differs is the time, the generation, and the approach.
Instead of doko and namlo, I carry a bag with my field gear (datasheets, field protocol, pens, binoculars, and camera). I study animal behavior, assess the effect of environmental factors on animals, and estimate plant and wildlife populations instead of harvesting and nurturing tree forest products. In the evening, my mother returned home with a doko full of fodder, grass and firewood but unlike her, I return back with stacks of data forms, etched with letters and numbers.

I aspire to continue this quest by training the upcoming generation of female wildlife technicians and future researchers in technical skills like research design, fieldwork and data analysis. I am working to build a wider network and to carry-on research work on dholes, conduct regional workshops, develop guidelines for dhole conservation, and write grants for research funds from the international community to conserve this endangered species. Lesser-known dholes deserve to be well known to the whole world and become a priority species for conservation. So, I want this quest not only to go on longer, but also to grow bigger with the involvement of future generations of researchers.
With this dream I am going to take a rest now, as it was a long, long day. We walked around 35 km (22 miles) in total and installed four cameras today. The following day awaits, and will allow me to get one step closer towards a time when dholes are a genuine conservation priority.

Trishna Rayamajhi is a Fulbright scholar studying natural resources and the environment with Cornell University. Her main areas of interest are quantitative ecology and genetics. Her master's research focuses on the occupancy and diet analysis of dholes in Nepal an endangered yet understudied species. Her study will help to uncover fundamental information about where dholes live and what species they prefer as their prey in Nepal. Trishna worked in the National Trust for Nature Conservation for three years before moving to the U.S. for her study. She completed her schooling at New Horizon Higher Secondary School and graduated from Kathmandu Forestry College.

362,Maani Truu,‘I fear each time I go on a plane’: Inside Nepal’s tourism industry and the risks travellers are willing to take,"Regular visitors to Nepal are very familiar with the risks that come with travelling throughout the country, but it's unlikely to stop them from going back.",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-01-21/inside-nepals-tourism-industry-why-travellers-keep-going-back/101868902,https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5b95142d9fa247bcef13b1245493c060?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1687&cropW=3000&xPos=0&yPos=310&width=862&height=485,2023-01-20T18:00:00Z,"Nepal's national tourism body started the new year with a resolution.
They wanted at least a million travellers to pass through the country before the end of 2023.
After three years of pandemic-induced disruption visitor numbers dwindled to about 151,000 in 2021, down from more than a million a year pre-COVID it was a big goal, and they had a strategy to match.

One of the first steps was opening a new international airport in Pokhara, a tourist hotspot and the country's second-largest city, nestled in the shadows of the towering Annapurna mountain range.
On the first day of the year, officials, industry leaders and Nepal's newly-elected prime minister gathered at the airstrip alongside the public for a grand inauguration, the date symbolising optimism for the future of a country heavily reliant on foreign tourism.
Such was the excitement that the city declared a public holiday for the occasion and strongly encouraged all residents to join in the celebration.
As Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal addressed the ceremony, no one could have predicted what would happen only two weeks later, just a few kilometres from where the lively crowd stood.

Nepal's worst aviation disaster in 30 years
On January 15, just before 11am local time, a Yeti Airlines ATR 72-500 approached the Pokhara airport from Kathmandu a speedy trip that usually takes less than half an hour. 
A witness noticed the plane approaching at a low altitude and pulled out his phone to start filming. The footage shows the twin-engine aircraft suddenly tilt to the side, its left wing pointed vertically towards the ground, before moving out of frame.
Moments before plane crashes in Nepal
Moments later the plane crashed into a hillside, killing all 68 passengers and four crew members on board. One Australian, 29-year-old Myron Love, was among the victims.
Investigations are underway, but it's so far unclear why the plane appeared to suddenly roll to its left as it approached the airport in clear conditions.
The small Himalayan nation home to eight of the world's 14 tallest mountains has a long history of aviation disasters, with nearly 350 people killed in plane or helicopter crashes since 2000. 
The plane was carrying 57 Nepalis, five Indians, four Russians, two South Koreans, and one person each from Argentina, Ireland, Australia and France.(AP: Yunish Gurung)
In May last year, 22 people were killed when a plane crashed 15 minutes after taking off from Pokhara. In 2018, another 51 passengers died when a Bangladeshi airliner came down in cloudy weather while approaching Kathmandu.
Years earlier, a History Channel documentary named Lukla Airport, near the base of Mount Everest, the world's most dangerous. 
But this tragedy marks Nepal's deadliest single aviation disaster in 30 years, and another blow to a tourism industry trying desperately to get back on its feet. 
A place like nowhere else on Earth
Most regular travellers to Nepal are familiar with the risk that comes with internal transit. Asked why they continue to travel there knowing this, the answer is often some variation of ""it's worth it"". 
""It's the only place my head stops thinking,"" says Australian academic Suzanne McLaren, who has been to Nepal three times and is planning a fourth trip next year.
""Being in the Himalayas, it's these magnificent mountains, and you are just this small dot. [The feeling] is quite hard to explain, but it's the most majestic place I've ever been.""
Suzanne McLaren, 53, says trekking in Nepal provides a unique psychological and physical challenge. (Supplied: Suzanne McLaren)
The Himalayan nation's unique topography meant it was always going to attract trekkers, climbers and mountaineers eager to summit the planet's highest peaks. It's this landscape that also necessitates the frequent use of air travel, which provides a crucial lifeline between remote villages and base camps. 
Not only is Nepal a gateway to Mount Everest, the most famous mountain in the world at a height of 8,849 metres above sea level, it's also home to other show-stopping formations, like Kanchenjunga (8,586 metres), Lhotse (8,516 metres), and Annapurna (8091 metres).
But travellers also remark on the friendliness of the people, the warmth of the culture, and the natural beauty closer to sea level. ""I've travelled to many countries, and this is just so special, the scenery and the people,"" Suzanne says.
The number of international tourists travelling to Nepal has grown steadily since the country opened up midway through the last century, peaking in 2019 with 1.17 million visitors 39,000 of them Australian.
""If you're a hiker, trekker or mountaineer, the Himalayas is a mecca,"" says Steve Kelly, a keen trekker who is planning his third trip to Nepal later this year.
""There is nowhere else in the world that can provide the same sense of adventure or the same awe-inspiring experience that the Himalayas provides for trekkers and mountaineers. That's why I keep going back.""
Som Tamang is passionate about showing travellers ""the real Nepal"". (Supplied: Som Tamang)
Som Tamang, who runs a Nepal tour company from Australia, says bookings have just started to pick back up after years of pandemic-induced border closures and, before that, the 2015 earthquakes, which killed around 9,000 people.
""Right now, in the last few weeks and last couple of months, we've been getting a lot of interest,"" he says.
Nepalese-born Som says he seeks to provide ""a real Nepal experience"" for travellers, mixing trekking and hiking with volunteering opportunities. Part of this, he says, means carefully communicating the risks associated with domestic travel in the country and providing a range of transport options to his customers.
""Even though I fly quite regularly up and down the Everest base camp I do fear each time I go on a plane, but that's the way it is,"" he says.
""It's about knowing the risk, not knowing the risk is another thing.""
Flying isn't the only danger
There are a number of reasons posited for Nepal's poor air safety record, some of them laid out in a 2019 report by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal.
""Nepal's majestic mountains and capricious weather patterns have created a huge challenge to flight operations,"" the report reads, noting that ""civil aviation in Nepal has been expanding rapidly"".
Since last week's crash, Som says he's received more inquiries from incoming travellers about alternative transport options.
While his company doesn't use flights from Kathmandu to Pokhara, instead relying on road travel, he says short flights are necessary to reach the Everest base camp unless travellers have an extra 10 days to spare. For that route, the company offers a private helicopter option at an additional cost.
""It's definitely having an impact on people's thoughts,"" he says, ""I truly don't think it will stop people travelling, but it will definitely impact people looking for alternative routes and alternative ways to get there rather than using domestic flights.""
Flying from Kathmandu to Pokhara takes just over 20 minutes, compared to about six-hours on a tourist bus which comes with its own danger. 
Due to the mountainous terrain, narrow and poorly maintained roads, and unpredictable weather, deadly traffic accidents are also common in Nepal. 
Less than a week into the year, six people were killed when a bus veered off a cliff in the country's west. In December, a bus accident about 90 kilometres from Kathmandu left 18 dead.
In recent years, concerns have been raised about crowding at Mount Everest's summit. (Nirmal Purja)
Then there are the dangers on the mountains; with more tourists crowding the trails comes increased risks of medical emergencies, altitude sickness and falls. Bad weather and avalanches are also difficult to predict and are often deadly. 
In 2015, an earthquake triggered an avalanche that wiped out a remote village 60 kilometres north of Kathmandu, on a route popular with foreign trekkers. A year earlier, an unseasonal snowstorm buried part of the popular Annapurna Circuit, killing at least 43 people.
""This kind of thing happens with monotonous regularity in the Himalayas,"" Steven says. 
The answer to why do people keep going back, its a fairly simple one, really: because its the Himalayas.""
Will this crash impact tourism?
The people ABC News spoke to for this story had no plans to cancel their upcoming trips to Nepal, and history suggests the incident won't be enough to deter those determined to see the country for themselves.
""At the end of the day, these are still very small risks, the rates of crashes compared to how many flights there are,"" Suzanne says. ""But there's a greater risk there than there is elsewhere, but you weigh that up.""

Melbourne resident Greg Nowotna is currently considering his options before a three-month trip later this year. In the late '80s and early '90s, he spent a cumulative nine months exploring Nepal, which he calls his ""favourite place on earth"".
He's now retired and the Tara crash last year and the Yeti incident have led him to rethink his plans to fly between cities.
""Now I'm obviously older, I'm not looking forward to spending eight hours on those buses because it's a very bone-jarring ride,"" he says. Instead, he's now planning to hire a private jeep to get him around.
But like others, the crash is not enough to make him reconsider travelling all together.
""The mountains are the biggest, most impressive thing I've ever seen in my life,"" he says. ""Even on my third trip to Nepal, I thought I'd seen the mountains and it wasn't going to impress me that much, but when I got there for a third time, my jaw still hit the floor.""
For Suzanne, there's another motivation for going back. ""The last thing Nepali people need is for tourists to stay away,"" she says.
When she was there in October, she says sometimes her group were only people staying in a lodge. ""The people were so grateful to have us, they were hoping so much that tourists were coming back.""
Som is confident tourists won't abandon Nepal because, ""it's a bucket list [item] for people, to climb the highest mountains on Earth"".
""As time goes by, unless there is another crash within the next month, then it will shake the country and tourism, but if not, it will go away from people's mind,"" he says.
""Anyone who's been there never regrets it.""",abc-news-au,ABC News (AU),Kanchenjunga Landscape,,,1.0,0.2,"Governance, Other",Other,Other,English
363,"Bhadra Sharma, Mujib Mashal",‘I see no future’: Sherpas leave the job they made famous,The risk-to-reward calculation for more Sherpa families argues for abandoning the mountain.,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/05/07/world/i-see-no-future-sherpas-leave-job-they-made-famous/,https://www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg?d=407,2023-05-07T07:01:00Z,"It is an increasingly common sentiment in a trade that has often been passed down through the generations, as the risk-to-reward calculation for more Sherpa families argues for abandoning the mountain.
The dangers of guiding climbers to the worlds highest peak, with the ever-present possibility of falls, avalanches and extreme weather, are evident. Nearly one-third of the 315 recorded deaths on Everest over the past century have been of Sherpa guides, according to the Himalayan Database, a mountaineering record-keeping body. Just last month, three Sherpas died when they were hit by a column of ice at a glacier near the mountains base camp.
The pay is also modest for all but those who make it to an elite and decorated club of guides, after years of grueling climbs and proven success. Sherpas early in their career make about $4,000, minus expenditures for arranging gear, for their once-a-season Everest expedition, which accounts for the bulk of their yearly income.
But what is pushing Sherpas to leave the industry, and to discourage their children from taking it up, is the scant security it offers. If a guide becomes disabled or ends up dead, there is little safety net for his family insurance payouts are limited, and a promised government welfare fund for Sherpa guides has not materialized.
Some who abandon the mountain are migrating abroad, a common path to better job prospects in one of Asias poorest countries. Others have found whatever work they can inside Nepal.
I wont suggest my hard-raised children go to the mountains and continue the same risky mountain guide jobs, said Kaji Sherpa, who quit in 2016 after eight years as a Sherpa guide and became a security guard for a local hydropower project.
Kaji Sherpa survived one of the deadliest disasters on Everest, when an avalanche in 2014 killed 16 Sherpas. Many mountain guides had hoped that the tragedy would bring a reckoning for the industry, prompting new safety measures and life insurance offerings.
After the disaster, the Sherpas threatened to cancel Everest expeditions, which bring in millions of dollars every year to Nepal. The government then announced the welfare fund for climbing guides, but, according to government officials and expedition leaders, it has never been activated.
Changes introduced by expedition operators have also brought little security. While insurance policies have been improved, they give the families of Sherpas only about $11,000 in the event of death and about $3,000 in case of injury. They also provide a guarantee of about $5,000 to cover expenses for a rescue operation in case of an accident.
To manage expeditions on Nepals peaks above 20,000 feet climbing is allowed on 414 of them the industry needs at least 4,000 high-altitude-acclimatized Sherpas, according to Tashi Lakpa Sherpa, the founder of 14 Peaks Expedition, a mountaineering company. Additionally, tens of thousands of porters are needed to carry loads to the base camps.
There is no firm data on trends in Sherpa employment. But there are signs of strain among both the Sherpa guides and expedition support workers.
In an effort to create more job opportunities on the mountains, the Nepali government recently issued a rule requiring that gear be taken by porters and yaks from the Syangboche, the site of the nearest airport to Everest, at 12,467 feet, to the base camp, at 17,500 feet.
But the government was forced to reverse the decision after expedition operators complained that there were not enough porters and yaks. In March, only weeks before the season began, officials ordered that helicopters be allowed to ferry the loads to the base camp.
As Sherpas abandon the mountains, expedition organizers say they are already seeing patterns.
Sherpa guides, famous for their endurance at high altitudes and in extreme climates, largely come from ethnic communities living close to Nepals mountains. Sherpas from the Khumbu region, seen as pioneers in mountaineering, are dwindling in numbers. Sherpas from Rolwaling, who started later, are beginning to transition to other ways of life. And Sherpas from the Kanchenjunga and Makalu regions are stepping into the void.
Some of those who leave pursue educations and jobs in the capital city, Kathmandu, or abroad. Thousands have relocated to the United States, Europe and Australia. A few of them have found work in climbing, while others take up gig work or other jobs.
They dont return to climb mountains or even go back to their villages, said Dawa Steven Sherpa, an expedition organizer. So you dont find a lot of Sherpas in Khumbu. Many of them are in Colorado, New York, Austria, Switzerland.
Among those who have left the mountains behind is Apa Sherpa, a famed guide who held the record for most summits of Everest until Kami Rita Sherpa broke it in 2018.
Apa Sherpa, who is now 63, moved to Utah in 2006 and settled his family there.
Its all for education, Tenzing Sherpa, the eldest son of Apa Sherpa and an accountant at a biotech firm, said by phone. Both my dad and mom were deprived of education, so he worked hard in the mountains.
For Kami Rita Sherpa, the decision to discourage his son from following him to Everest came from his own hard journey.
Despite being in an elite echelon of Sherpas he has scaled Everest 26 times his earnings barely cover the expenses of his family of four. They live in a rented apartment in Kathmandu.
Every spring, when Kami Rita Sherpa leads his next expedition to Everest, his family holds its breath.
I pray day and night and light candles at Boudhanath stupa for his well-being when he remains away from home, his wife, Lakpa Jangmu, said, referring to a Buddhist shrine in Kathmandu. The sigh of relief comes only when I see him entering through that door.
Kami Rita Sherpa said he would continue working on the mountain for the rest of his career.
If I lead an expedition team, scores of Sherpas get jobs as porters, he said, adding that it brings the state thousand of dollars. I will keep working at least for a few years.
But he and his wife have ensured other paths for their children.
Their daughter, Pasang, 21, is in the final semester of a bachelors program in information technology.
Lakpa, their 24-year-old son, is completing a degree in tourism management.
I know about the legacy he holds, Lakpa said of his father. I plan to be a landscape photographer that will keep me closer to the mountain, but from a distance.",,The Boston Globe,Kanchenjunga Landscape,,,0.8,0.4,"Governance, Other",Sacred Himalayan Landscape,Other,English

&amp;#x200B;
**Common Names**
Red Panda (English); Habre, Hobrakpa, Punde Kundo (Nepali)
&amp;#x200B;
**Species Description**
Red-ginger colour coat on the body, with white snout, inner ears and cheek patches. Dark brown/ black legs and paws. Bushy tail with rings of alternating light/dark red colour.
&amp;#x200B;
**Species Ecology**
Red Pandas occur only in the temperate forest zone of the Eastern Himalayan eco-region characterised by *Abies spectabilies, Tsuga dumosa, Aesculus spp., Betula utilis, Pinus wallichiana, Quercus spp., Rhododendron spp.* and Acer forests with bamboo thicket in the understory with humus ground. Red Pandas are found between elevations of 2,800 m up to 3,600 m. This species is largely vegetarian, with a diet consisting predominantly of young leaves and shoots of bamboo, but also feeds on fruits, roots, grasses, acorns, lichens, insects, grubs, small mammals, eggs and birds. Red Pandas become sexually mature at 18 months and produce one to four young after a gestation period of approximately 134 days.
&amp;#x200B;
**Conservation Status**
Global: Vulnerable C1
National: Endangered C2a(i)
Rationale for assessment: The Red Panda (*Ailurus fulgens*) has been nationally assessed as Endangered under criterion C due to a small population of 317-582 individuals spilt across 11 subpopulations, with the highest estimated number of individuals in a single subpopulation (Kanchanjunga) of 67. The population in Nepal continues to face declines due to human disturbances, deforestation and grazing of livestock in addition to forest fires, poaching for the species pelt and death caused by feral or local dogs. Although the Red Panda mainly occurs within conservation areas this species remains threatened and in decline. It does occur in neighbouring parts of China but it is not known if individuals ever move across the borders.
&amp;#x200B;
**Legal status**
CITES Appendix I Listed in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2029 (1973) as protected priority species.
&amp;#x200B;
**National Population Size**
Total: 317-582
Trend: Declining
The most recent population estimate for the Red Panda in Nepal considered 11 subpopulations (Annapurnna, Manaslu, Darchula, Dhorpatan, Gaurishankar, Kanchanjungha, Khaptad, Langtang, Rara, Sagarmatha, Sakhuwasabha East, Sakhuwasabha West ) with a total population ranging between 317 and 582 individuals. The global population is estimated between 8,000 and 10,000 individuals.
&amp;#x200B;
**National Distribution**
The Red Panda is distributed from Ilam, Panchthar and Taplejung districts in the east to Darchula district in the west Nepal. A recent GIS based study suggests a gradual decline in probability of occurrence of Red Panda from east to west Nepal. A similar study estimates 67% of Red Panda habitat within the Sacred Himalayan Landscape area. Red Pandas occur within the protected areas of Annapurna Conservation Area, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, Makalu-Barun National Park, Manaslu Conservation Area, Rara National Park, Sagarmatha National Park, Lantang National Park. Outside of protected areas Red Pandas occur in the districts of Dolakha, Ilam, Panchthar, Ramechhap, Sankhuwasabha, Solukhumbu and Taplejung district.
&amp;#x200B;
**Distribution outside Nepal**
Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar.
&amp;#x200B;
**Main Threats**
– Habitat loss and degradation due to human disturbances, cleaing for livestock grazing and agriculture.
– Man-made forest fires.
– Poaching.
– Injury/death caused by local dogs.
– Inbreeding.
&amp;#x200B;
**Conservation Measures in Place**
Approximately 22.5% of potential Red Panda habitat in Nepal is protected by a network of protected areas. A number of organisations including Red Panda Network (Nepal and US), WWF, NTNC, DNPWC have been conducting scientific research and community-based Red Panda conservation. This includes a long-term monitoring and a community-based conservation project in lower Kanchenjunga Mountain Complex; development of an action plan for Red Panda in Langtang National Park; survey of the species in the Sacred Himalayan Landscape; a GIS based nationwide assessment of red panda distribution and a Red Panda Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) workshop in 2010.
&amp;#x200B;
**Conservation Recommendations**
i) Identify and verify potential and key habitats of Red Panda.
ii) Obtain accurate baseline data on the distribution and population status of the species in identified areas based on the six complexes and 11 subpopulations.
iii) Conduct scientific research on genetic diversity, population structure and habitat and ecology of the Red Panda in Nepal.
iv) Set up protection and management programmes for key habitats through government and community participation.

An elephant named Pang Pha learned how to peel a banana with her trunkbut only yellow-brown bananas. Credit: Kaufmann et al., 2023/Current Biology
An elephant's prehensile trunk is a marvel of biology, featuring as many as 60,000 muscles that enable the animal to not just breathe, eat, and drink water, but also to communicate and pinch or grasp objects, among other abilities. Some elephants have been known to make rudimentary tools with their trunks to scratch themselves, repel insects, or even block roads. And one Asian elephant, named Pang Pha, in the Berlin Zoo learned how to peel a banana, according to a new paper published in the journal Current Biologya highly unusual ability for a pachyderm, and one the other Asian elephants in the Berlin Zoo don't possess.
We discovered a very unique behavior, said co-author Michael Brecht of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlins Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience. What makes Pang Pha's banana peeling so unique is a combination of factorsskillfulness, speed, individuality, and the putatively human originrather than a single behavioral element.
Brecht and his co-authors first heard about Pang Pha's unusual ability from her zoo caretakers and decided to conduct a series of experiments, presenting the elephant with about 10 bananas each round and filming her behavior. The first experiments involved Pang Pha alone, and while she repeatedly raised her trunktypical begging behavior for elephantswhen approached with bananas, for the first few weeks, the elephant didn't peel any of them. Eventually the scientists realized that whether or not Pang Phase peeled a banana depended on its ripeness. She preferred to devour green or yellow bananas whole and rejected brown bananas entirely.
It was the yellow-brown bananas that Pang Pha singled out for peeling, and she was able to do it faster than most humans. First, she grasped the banana with the tip of her trunk and then broke it against the side of the distal trunk. Next, she shook the banana until the pulp fell out. She then grabbed the pulp and ate it, discarding the peel. The process continued until there was almost no pulp left inside the peel. Pang Pha made sure of that by checking several times with her trunk in case there was any lingering pulp she might have missed.

For a second round of experiments, the researchers filmed the banana-feeding behavior of Pang Pha with other elephantsnamely, her daughter Anchali and another female Asian elephant named Drumbo. In that social setting, Pang Pha consumed most of the yellow-brown bananas whole instead of peeling them. But she kept the last yellow-brown banana for later and did peel that one. Neither of the other elephants peeled their bananas.
While there are random Internet videos of various elephant species also peeling bananas, the authors did not observe the behavior among the Berlin Zoo's other Asian elephants, nor among the African elephants housed in the Vienna Zoo. So where did Pang Pha learn to do it? The authors suggest it stems from her early history. She arrived at the zoo in 1987 as a baby, and her keepers partially bottle-fed her. But her primary keeper also would peel bananas in front of her and feed her the pulp, and it seems Pang Pha watched this and learned how to do it herself. Pang Pha did not pass this learned behavior down to her daughter, Anchali, however, perhaps because Pang Pha prefers to peel her bananas when she's alone.
This all suggests that elephants, in general, have unexpected cognitive abilities and manipulative skills. ""Presumably human-derived complex manipulative behaviors like this were unknown in elephants or, to our knowledge, most other species,"" the authors concluded. ""Our case study on Pang Pha's banana peeling provides insights about elephant manipulation and cognition not available from other, conventional routes of investigation.""

Ray Meibaum/The St. Louis Zoo
Rani, a female Asian elephant at the St. Louis Zoo, unexpectedly died after a dog running loose agitated her herd, zoo officials said.
The 27-year-old mother of three died a week ago.
""We are absolutely devastated. We ask for the community's thoughts and support during this difficult time,"" said Michael Macek, the zoo's director, in a news release on Tuesday. ""Our team of professional animal care experts did everything possible, but we couldn't save Rani."" 
On the afternoon of Oct.13, a small dog wandered into the zoo and made its way near the elephant habitat, according to the zoo. The Elephant Care team worked to capture the dog, but its presence caused an elephant that was outside the barn to become agitated. 
Rani was indoors eating dinner at the time, and never saw the dog.
But the elephant care members ""observed Rani become agitated in reaction to the vocalizations from the herd. They saw Rani circle and vocalize, all within a very brief period, before collapsing.""
A necropsy found preexisting changes in the elephant's heart. It was unknown whether the changes were a factor in her death, the zoo news release read, and further testing is being done.
The dog has been handed over to a shelter, according to the zoo. It wasn't immediately clear how the dog got into the zoo.
Rani and her mother Ellie came to the zoo in 2001, upon recommendation by the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums Asian Elephant Species Survival Plan, which aims to manage North America's Asian elephant population and maximize their health and genetic diversity, the zoo said.
Ellie, 52, still lives at the zoo, among seven other elephants in a three-generation family.
""Rani was a special member of this elephant family group,"" said Katie Pilgram-Kloppe, who manages the zoo's River's Edge area where the elephants live. Rani loved playing with her sisters, she added, and was known for making ""a unique squeaking noise that her daughter Jade also mimics.""
The rest of the herd calmed down quickly and are doing well, the zoo said.

Officials claim Arikomban (rice tusker) - named for his tendency to raid local shops for rice - has killed seven people.
Locals near his original habitat had demanded his relocation for months.
On Saturday, he was tranquillised and shifted to Periyar Tiger Reserve, around 80km (49.7 miles) away.
Government authorities have called the massive mission a success - they say they are monitoring Arikomban's movements, and have received the first set of signals from a radio collar attached to him. 
But activists say the debate points to a larger issue of human-wildlife conflict and cannot be solved by displacing one animal. 
According to the last elephant census in 2017, India has close to 30,000 wild elephants - around 60% of wild Asian elephants. Loss of habitat and fragmentation often force them to enter human habitats and raid crops, leading to conflicts.
Arikomban, believed to be more than 30 years old, was a familiar sight for people who lived near the Devikulam forest range in Idukki district for decades. Locals told The New Indian Express newspaper that earlier, when huts in the area were made of bamboo and grass, the elephant caused little damage when he came foraging for food.
But as the population grew and houses made of concrete became common, the elephant started damaging buildings and having run-ins with humans, leading to protests from locals.

Image caption, Activists had raised concerns about Arikomban being turned into a captive elephant
Initially, the state forest department planned to capture Arikomban and make him a trained captive elephant. But animal welfare activists approached the Kerala high court against this.
""How can we continue to capture all elephants and put them in captivity?"" conservationist MN Jayachandran .
Kerala has hundreds of captive elephants - many of them owned by individuals or temple boards - that are leased out for temple festivals and other programmes. Activists say they are often mistreated and have tried to raise awareness about their plight for years.
The high court then formed a five-member committee, which recommended that the elephant be captured and relocated to an area where there would be little chance of conflict with humans. The panel's initial suggestion of moving the elephant to the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve in Palakkad district sparked protests from people living there.
The Kerala government then approached the Supreme Court to appeal against the high court's order to relocate Arikomban. The top court, however, refused to interfere in the matter.
The government then began scouting for alternative locations to move the elephant and began a massive operation - involving a task force of 150 officials - to track and capture it.
After a two-day-long operation, a tranquilised Arikomban was herded into a truck on Saturday and relocated to the Periyar Tiger Reserve.
Reports said that authorities had imposed a curfew and deployed police personnel in case locals protested against Arikomban's arrival. However, the elephant's arrival was reportedly greeted with cheers.

So why is he controversial now?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64480308,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16E7A/production/_128481839_padayappaphotobyhadleerenjithimg_2081.jpg,2023-02-04T02:49:19Z,"Padayappa is an iconic figure in the southern Indian state of Kerala. 
The wild elephant, who lives in the state's lush jungles, is known for his flappy ears, massive tusks and friendly ways. 
Padayappa's bond with the people of Kerala goes back decades. 
Locals in the town of Munnar, near Padayappa's habitat, call him a ""gentle giant"" who has never hurt anyone, even though he occasionally pilfers food from their homes and farms at night. 
His name comes from the 1999 blockbuster movie Padayappa - a swashbuckling tale of betrayal and family honour - starring superstar Rajinikanth. 
Padayappa is also a favourite with tourists, many of whom flock to the hilly town to click photographs of the animal. 
But over the past few months, the elephant, who is believed to be 50 years old, has developed a bit of a bad boy image. 
Locals say that Padayappa, who would once take leisurely strolls in and around the town, has become noticeably irritable around humans. 
In January, reports say, the elephant broke the windshields of a truck and a tuk-tuk before running amok in a nearby butter bean farm and eating the crop. 
The incident was the latest in a series of episodes where Padayappa displayed violent tendencies, sparking concerns about changes in his behaviour. 
Some attribute Padayappa's outbursts to him being in musth - a period during which reproductive hormones surge in mature male elephants, making them prone to aggression.
Image source, Hadlee Renjith
Image caption, Padayappa is often seen strolling around Munnar, a small hilly town in Kerala
However, experts say that it's excessive human intervention in Padayappa's natural habitat that's causing problems.
""Even elephants in musth do not get violent unless they are provoked,"" says Dr PS Easa, a member of the Asian Elephant Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
He adds that Padayappa needs large ""disturbance-free habitats"" where he can roam and feed at will. 
""Elephant habitats need to be protected and steps should be taken to prevent their fragmentation,"" Dr Easa says. 
Human-animal conflicts are often reported in India as shrinking natural habitats force wild animals to enter human settlements in search of food and shelter. In Kerala itself, rogue tuskers separated from their herds have killed 105 people between 2018 and 2022.
In January, after state forest officials captured alive a rogue elephant in Palakkad district, they found that its body had more than a dozen pellet marks, possibly from air guns. Locals claimed that the elephant had been wreaking havoc in their village for months and alleged it had even killed a man.
Padayappa's human neighbours say he is different.
Lalita Mani, who lives in a town near Munnar, says Padayappa has visited her house at least thrice and eaten bananas and bamboo. 
Once, she says, Padayappa uprooted ten banana trees from her field and ""stood there and took his time to eat the fruit before slowly walking away"". 
Yet, Ms Mani has nothing but affection for him. ""The poor creature comes when he feels hungry. He does no harm,"" she says.
Padayappa is mostly found roaming in and around the forests of Munnar, although he makes occasional detours to other areas. 
Hadlee Renjith, a wildlife photographer who has been tracking Padayappa's movements since 2014, describes him as a majestic animal whose left tusk ""is slightly longer than the right one"". 
Mr Renjith sees the pachyderm at least once in two months. ""I film from a safe distance. He ignores me, but appears to be posing for the photograph,"" he says, adding that Padayappa is the ""most human-friendly"" wild elephant he has ever seen.
Stories about Padayappa's mischievous but friendly demeanour have made him a local celebrity.
If he is crossing the road, locals stop their vehicles to let him pass. Tourists come looking for him to click selfies. And shopkeepers say they don't even mind the elephant occasionally raiding their stores, as he brings a lot of customers. 
""Padayappa is our brand ambassador,"" says Vinod Vattekkat, vice-president of Showcase Munnar, an initiative that promotes tourism in the region.

Image caption, Tourists flock to click selfies with Padayappa
That is why the sudden change in Padayappa's behaviour has surprised many people. 
In December, Padayappa reportedly trampled on two bikes when some tourists tried to block his way. The men were apparently trying to take a photograph of the elephant. 
In April, he charged at a bus which had around 50 passengers, and damaged its windshield.
Padayappa's fans believe that his outbursts are triggered by humans who want to ""annoy"" him. 
Mr Renjith recalls an incident from last year, where Padayappa was trying to cross a road. A bus driver tried to speed past him instead of waiting. 
""Padayappa didn't like it. He thrust his trunk into the vehicle and its windshield broke,"" says the photographer, adding that the elephant immediately disengaged from the vehicle.

Image caption, Padayappa (tusks visible) with a herd of elephants
Suresh Palraj, who works at a plantation in Munnar, says tuk-tuk and tractor drivers often provoke the elephant by continuously honking at him. 
In December, forest authorities filed a case against a man who tried to scare Padayappa away from his tea garden by blaring his horn.
Experts say that tourism picking up in the scenic region, after a pandemic-induced lull, could also have irritated the elephant.
""There is nothing unusual about Padayappa's behaviour. All wild elephants get irritable when you get close to them and try to click selfies,"" says wildlife expert James Zachariah, who has observed Padayappa for two decades. 
""They charge because they feel threatened. But that does not necessarily mean they will attack you,"" he says, adding that he thinks a lot of the discourse around Padayappa's behaviour is ""exaggerated"". 
Since Padayappa's actions started making headlines in India, he has also received a lot of media attention.

To make their Frankenstein-style meatball, Vow says it grabbed the myoglobin gene from mammoth DNA. Myoglobin is a protein that stores oxygen in the muscles, gives meat a red color, and makes that red juice that oozes out of a medium-rare steak.Vow says it filled the gaps in the mammoth myoglobin gene with DNA from the African elephant, and injected the result into sheep muscle cells. They grew the meat from there.You may be wondering: Does that really count as a mammoth meatball? And what the heck does that taste like?Vow's 'mammoth meatball' is presented at NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam.PIROSCHKA VAN DE WOUW/AMSTERDAM/Reuters
Nobody tasted the meatball, according to Vow, because they were concerned that humans today might be allergic to the ancient protein.Others have tasted a similar mammoth myoglobin creation, though. The Belgian startup Paleo says it added woolly mammoth myoglobin to a plant-based burger. The founder and CEO Hermes Sanctorum told Insider that it tasted ""more intense — more meaty"" than veggie burgers made with beef myoglobin.A visitor looks at a complete mammoth skeleton in Lyon, France.Emmanuel Foudrot/Reuters
But he wasn't really tasting the flavor of mammoth. Even the mammoth meatball isn't very mammoth-y.""I would definitely never suggest that this is the same as eating a meatball made out of mammoth flesh,"" James Ryall, Vow's chief science officer, told Insider.The 'mammoth meatball' may as well be an 'elephant meatball'Love Dalén, a professor of evolutionary genomics who studies the mammoth genome, told Insider that the coding of the myoglobin gene in woolly mammoths is ""identical"" to that of Asian elephants. His latest paper, published in the journal Cell on Friday, compares the animals' DNA to determine what makes a mammoth a mammoth.A newborn Asian elephant calf plays with its mother La Belle and grandmother La petite at the Ramat Gan safari near Tel Aviv, Israel.AP Photo/Ariel Schalit
There are a few parts of the myoglobin DNA code that vary within each species, just like any DNA sequence in any species.But on the whole, myoglobin in woolly mammoths and Asian elephants has the same DNA sequence, Dalén said.""As far as we can see, no mammoth meatballs have been created. Rather, it's [Asian] elephant meatballs,"" he told Insider in an email.Myoglobin isn't the main element of a meat's flavorThe juices that come out of a cooked steak are red because of myoglobin, not blood.Leonard Ortiz/Digital First Media/Orange County Register via Getty Images
The flavor of a meat mainly comes from the aromas of the fat and the meatiness, or umami, of the muscle fibers. The mammoth meatball doesn't have either of those elements from woolly mammoth.""Fat and caramelization of proteins is usually what I think about as affecting the flavor of meat,"" Gregg Rentfrow, a meat specialist and professor at the University of Kentucky Animal and Food Science Extension, told Insider.Fat, dispersed throughout the muscle and built up in visible deposits, has different qualities and aromas depending on an animal's diet. That's what gives different meat different flavors — steak versus chicken, or pork versus lamb.Ryall argues that lab-grown meat is different.""We're not talking about a cut of meat from an animal, are we? We're talking about pure muscle cells, and the flavor from pure muscle cells doesn't come from the fat, it comes from the proteins,"" like myoglobin, he said.Mammoth myoglobin doesn't necessarily bring mammoth flavorThough he didn't taste it, Ryall said everyone could smell the meatball while it was cooking.""The aroma was nothing like what you would expect for lamb,"" he said. ""The best way that I can describe it, is that it was closer to something like crocodile,"" which is another type of meat Vow has grown in the lab.A crocodile in Bangkok, Thailand.DEA / G.SIOEN / Getty Images
Myoglobin is known to have an iron-y taste, regardless of which animal it comes from. Because of that, according to Rentfrow, the quantity of myoglobin can affect a meat's flavor. Beef has a lot more myoglobin than chicken, which is why it's a darker meat with a more metallic aroma.So the use of mammoth (or elephant) myoglobin doesn't necessarily bring a mammoth flavor to the sheep muscle tissue that Vow used. One could argue that the company's creation is actually a sheep meatball.So why make a mammoth meatball that doesn't taste like mammoth?""The whole point of doing something with mammoth was to do something so outrageous that it would break through into mainstream media,"" Ryall said.Food systems produce 37% of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are warming the planet and driving catastrophic climate change. Startups like Vow argue that growing animal cells in giant steel vats, like a brewery, would use less land, water, and energy.That could allow consumers to continue eating meat without the ecological and animal-rights consequences.The first lab-grown meat products — or cultured meat, as the industry calls it — could be hitting US shelves following regulatory approval this year. Mammoth won't be one of them.Real mammoth meat still exists, but it's in bad shapeUnlike the people behind Vow and Paleo, Dalén has tasted the flesh of a real mammoth. In 2012, he tried a small piece of frozen meat from the preserved carcass of a baby mammoth in Siberia.The carcass of a baby mammoth lies in a museum in the Arctic city of Salekhard, in Russia.Sergei Cherkashin/Reuters
Of course that animal was frozen for thousands of years, so it probably had some freezer burn, to say the least.""The mammoth meat tasted like what I would imagine putrified beef jerky, with no salt or spices, would taste like,"" Dalén said.Suffice it to say, we're still waiting to learn what real mammoth meat tastes like.Read the original article on Business Insider",business-insider,Business Insider,Asian Elephant,,,0.1,0.2,"Wildlife, Climate and Energy, Other",Other,"Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus), Other",English

Adapted from the novel of the same name by Kate DiCamillo, The Magician's Elephant is part wish-fulfillment, part post-War reconciliation story. That description might give you the sense that the film has much more going for it than it actually does, however, as the entire film really has the same tactility of a five year old's bedtime story (it doesn't help that the animation style is cribbed from much more robust studios). Beginning with a torrent of exposition, we are told that Peter (Noah Jupe), is an orphan being raised by a grizzly war veteran by the name of Vilna (Mandy Patinkin, in a distinctly thick and completely unjustified Russian dialect). The two live in the fictional country of Baltese, which was, at one point, the kind of mystical town where everyone had some level of magical ability. But, as the narrator tells us, (Natasia Demtriou, who also plays the mysterious fortune teller), the ""Great Foreign War"" cast a permanent wet blanket over the town's majesty.
Peter has grown up believing that his parents and younger sister, Adel (Pixie Davies) all died in said Great Foreign War, but one day, by happenstance, he meets the fortune teller in a big bright red tent in the middle of the town square, who tells him that his sister is indeed, alive. In order to track her down, the fortune teller ominously tells Peter to ""follow the elephant,"" which immediately elicits consternation and disbelief. ""There aren't any elephants!"" Peter exclaims, as does his foster father Vilna, who insists the boy stop believing in impossible things in favor of becoming a soldier. The next day, a traveling magician (Benedict Wong) attempts to perform for the town, but his poor skills accidentally summons a massive elephant from the sky. Peter believes the animal to be proof positive of his sister's existence, and decides to win the elephant from captivity. In order to do so, he is tasked with completing ""three impossible tasks"" set forth by Baltese's childish king (Aasif Mandvi) who is only motivated by the petulant desire for constant entertainment. With the encouragement of his downstairs neighbor (Brian Tyree Henry), Peter agrees to the tasks, which turn out to be not so much impossible as mildly inconvenient, and, well, you can figure out the rest.
The Magician's Elephant is not a complicated film, and its obvious didacticism is, on some level, expected. This is a children's film, and, to that end, there is a solid commitment to lean storytelling and an admirable diversity amongst the talented voice cast. It seems strange, then, that Wong and Maandvi's characters are both drawn with White avatars, considering the actors are Asian and Indian, respectively, which really kneecap other, better representations like interracial coupling. But the bigger flaw of the film is embedded in its very DNA. The Magician's Daughter wants you to take away a message of defying the odds, but what is impossible about defeating a burly soldier with a fairy tale book or using a parachute to jump from a rooftop, or making a traumatized countess (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) laugh? The longer the film harps on such platitudes of beating the odds, the more it feels mired in mediocrity. Because magic is impossible and so is the revivification of dead relatives. If the message is that believing is enough to get you to accomplish a task like finding a map, then most of it feels like sloppy writing and not genuine uplift. Ultimately the film eschews the book's more harrowing and interesting plot point of post-war familial reconciliation for one about the vague accomplishment of erstwhile ""impossible"" things, but the decision to do so doesn't endear it to younger audiences so much as patronize them.",,Boing Boing,Asian Elephant,,,0.1,0.2,Other,Other,Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus),English

The Zurich Zoo in Switzerland recently uploaded a heartbreaking video showing an elephant and her mother desperately attempting to revive a newborn calf inside their enclosure.
Farha, Zurich Zoos 17-year-old Asian elephant, gave birth to a male elephant calf on Saturday after 22 months of pregnancy.
The labor started much like it does for elephants in the wild, as seen in the video uploaded by Zurich Zoo on YouTube on Monday. 
Fahra gives birth to a male calf, often referred to as a bull elephant, with her mother, Ceyla-Himali, present.

Shortly after being born, Fahra's calf can be seen in the video briefly moving as he lies in the sand. What is supposed to be a joyous moment turns into heartache when the calf suddenly lies motionless inside its enclosure.
Fahra tries to nudge her newborn calf with her foot, but he does not show any signs of life. She then tries to put her trunk into the calfs mouth, something that only close elephant family members and friends do, according to Elephant Aid.
Fahra and her mother try their hardest to revive the calf, but to no avail.

Zurich Zoo attributed the bull elephants death to being born ""very weak.""
The expected elephant birth in the Kaeng Krachan Elephant Park at the beginning of the year did not have the desired outcome. In the night from Saturday to Sunday, the 17-year-old elephant cow Farha gave birth to an elephant bull. Unfortunately, the calf died shortly after birth due to weakness.
The Swiss zoo said it has scheduled a pathological examination of the cause of death.

This is the sixth elephant death at Zurich Zoo since 2020, the Franz Weber Foundation (FFW) said in a press release on Tuesday.
The deaths started in April 2020 and August 2020 when two young elephants were trampled to death by other elephants.
This was followed by three more deaths, with the most recent one until now involving a 5-year-old elephant named Ruwani in July 2022. These deaths were attributed to Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesvirus (EEHV), a condition that most elephants carry latently, according to Reuters.

FFW's recent press release quoted Dr. Keith Lindsay, a member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature African Elephant Specialist Group, who said that elephants experience trauma from witnessing deaths.
Because elephants are highly social and intelligent animals, they perceive these deaths as a real trauma a huge sadness for all the surviving animals, Lindsay explained.
FFW reported that Fahras calf was her third one that did not survive.
The foundation noted that elephants typically have an interval of five years between pregnancies, but Fahras previous pregnancy was only about a year before her most recent one.
FFW also noted Fahras weight, linking the obesity of elephants to several problems such as reproductive issues and labor complications.

The Bengal tiger, an eight-year-old female named Sheba, had been living in the enclosure at an address in the outskirts of Johannesburg until her escape on Friday evening.
She killed two dogs, a pig and a deer and injured a 39-year-old man before local residents managed to chase her away using torches.
""She mauled his lower legs round below his knees and also below his waist,"" said Gresham Mandy of the local community policing forum that brings together residents and police representatives to work on safety issues.
""The decision was made to euthanize her to prevent any further tragedy this morning,"" he told Reuters.
Police had spent days trying to locate the tiger until she was spotted in the early hours of Wednesday entering a dwelling.
Animal rights activist Dr Louise de Waal said it was a sad end for ""this poor animal who has never asked to be a pet in somebody's backyard"".
Tigers are not native to Africa. The person who had been keeping Sheba did not speak to media and the origin of the animal was unknown.
South Africa's Gauteng province, where Johannesburg is located, requires no permit to own wild and exotic animals.
The National Society for the Protection of Animals (NSPCA), which took part in the search for Sheba, said police officers tried to bring her back to her enclosure but those attempts were unsuccessful and the safety of the community was prioritised.
""You can clearly see in a situation like this, because of how lax the legislation is when it comes to keeping these animals, often the welfare of the animal is simply disregarded,"" said Keshvi Nair, public relations officer at the NSPCA.

Run by the Mangrove Action Project, the competition - now in its ninth year - aims to show the relationships between wildlife, coastal communities and mangrove forests, as well as the fragility of these unique ecosystems, both above and below the waterline.
Mr Bhattacharyya's winning image, called The Finest Flower of the Mangroves, shows a young Royal Bengal tigress in its natural mangrove habitat, peering at the photographer.
""The solitary figure of the tiger, standing amidst the lush green mangrove forest vegetation, poignantly underscores the isolation it must endure in an ever-shrinking habitat,"" said competition judge Daisy Gilardini.
In 2021, West Bengal Forest Department estimated there were only 96 Royal Bengal tigers in the region.
Mangroves are an important protection against climate change, with one acre (4,000sq m) of mangrove forest absorbing nearly the same amount of carbon dioxide as an acre of Amazon rainforest.
The forests also protect coastlines from eroding, as intense storms grow more frequent.
""Photographs of mangroves play a multifaceted role in advocating for the conservation and protection of these critical coastal forests,"" said another of the judges, Fulvio Eccardi.
Fellow judge Octavio Aburto added: ""The images from this year captivated our imagination... giving us hope and illuminating a positive future for mangrove ecosystems.""

José Rubén Nava headed a zoo in Chilpancingo, the capital of the southwestern state of Guerrero. He was replaced on Jan 12. after authorities discovered what he’d done.
“These four animals were slaughtered and cooked on the zoo’s premises, and were served as food at the end of the year party,” said Fernando Ruiz Gutierrez, the Guerrero state Environment Department’s director of wildlife in a video announcing the allegations against Nava on Tuesday. “This put the health of the people who ate them at risk, because these animals were not fit for human consumption.”
Pygmy goats—while somewhat similar to the common breed widely found and used in food—are smaller, stocky, and rare. It’s unclear if the guests were aware that they were eating zoo animals during the party, or if any official charges have been filed against Nava.
Authorities alleged that along with the slaying of the goats, Nava engaged in the selling and trading of animals as well. They specifically mentioned that a zebra was traded for tools that were supposedly needed for repairs around the facility, although the tools were never found by authorities. Nava also allegedly gave at least one deer and four rare African Watusi cattle to private citizens. Several other creatures were also missing, including a jaguarundi, a female coyote, 10 specimens of reptiles, a baby macaw and a red-tailed hawk.
The investigation into the so-called “Zoochilpan” began in January after the suspicious death of a deer that was discovered by nearby residents, who notified authorities, the environmental department members said in the video.
Nava gave his own press conference on Wednesday denying the allegations. He claimed that members of the environmental department were waging a “dirty war” against him because one of its top officials wanted his nephew to run the zoo, instead of Nava.
The illegal sale of exotic wildlife is rampant in Mexico. It’s become somewhat common for authorities to discover private zoos or animals like lions and tigers kept as house pets when raiding the homes and properties of members of organized crime. It’s also not uncommon for these animals to escape their owners and run loose in towns and cities around the country.
In November 2021, an obese Bengal tiger was discovered wandering along a rural highway in the state of Jalisco. Another Bengal tiger escaped from a private owner on the outskirts of the city of Guadalajara in May 2020. Later that same year, a woman was photographed walking a baby tiger on a leash in a Mexico City shopping mall.
But the questionable practices of zoos and people involved in the exotic wildlife trade is not unique to Mexico. Over the past month, a series of animal escapes, a mysterious death, and disappearances at a zoo in Dallas has captivated true crime sleuths around the United States.

The excitement around cellular agriculture largely stems from the benefits and disruptive potential on offer. Innovators in the field can create products from cell cultures as opposed to whole plants or animals.
Proponents believe that, when compared to conventional animal agriculture, the production of animal tissue in bioreactors will prove a safe and more sustainable source of protein. Cellular agriculture, it is hoped, will offer a means to meet the rising appetite of the growing global population, projected to reach 9bn people by 2050, without exhausting finite natural resources and raising carbon emission levels.
Cultivated meat companies most frequently focus on the largest meat categories beef, chicken and pork. However, Primeval Foods has stepped away from the norm and instead is concentrating its efforts on more exotic fair.
Meat market wide-open for disruption from exotic cell ag
We are currently working on: the Siberian tiger, leopard, black panther, Bengal tiger, white lion, lion, and zebra. We sourced cells of the big cats from captive animals, and for the zebra, we sourced it from an exotic meat market, Yilmaz Bora, Managing Partner of Ace Ventures, told FoodNavigator.
Most of us arent used to seeing zebra on the menu and big cats are unlikely to have made the dinner table in the majority of our homes. So why has Primeval set its sights on such a unique niche?
Primeval points to the fact that no other animal has been domesticated since the agricultural revolution. This, the company argued, means the trillion-dollar meat market is wide open for start-ups who are willing to double down on innovative ideas.
Importantly, Primeval stressed, as a novel production method, cultivated meat allows companies to produce food from species without slaughtering animals opening up the previously unavailable cultivated meat market.
The reason we consume traditional species like beef and chicken today is not that they are the tastiest, healthiest, or most nutritious ones. It's because they are the ones easiest to domesticate. Since cultivated meat allowed us to go beyond domesticated species, now we can explore the tastiest, healthiest, and most nutritious [options]. And based on demographics and taste preferences, we will see new signature foods and dishes from each cuisine/country; for example, Giraffe meat might be the new flagship of Italian delicatessen, or Bengal Tiger might be the new signature ingredient in Chinese cuisine, Bora predicted.
Could exotic meat deliver health outcomes?
Bora believes that the history of animal husbandry and the development of domesticated species means that wild animals could deliver health benefits not associated with the consumption of mainstream meats.
Cultivated exotic meat consumption might lead humanity to a new evolution for our brain and gut microbiome because of the unique protein and amino acid profile - without the downside such as cholesterol and saturated fats.
We are envisioning a future where we consume cultivated jaguar meat to have better sleep and mood, or cultivated elephant meat to increase our cognitive performance, or paediatrics might warn parents to feed their child with cultivated lion meat at least two times a week to have a better bone and muscle development. This is just tip of the iceberg.
Launching in high-end restaurants
Primeval currently plans to launch its commercial offering with exotic meat burger patties. Pending regulatory approvals, the lion, tiger of zebra dishes will first be offered to Michelin-starred restaurants.
Certainly, exotic meats have already made the menu of fine-dining establishments like Londons ARCHIPELAGO Restaurant, which serves up dishes like crocodile, camel and kangaroo; Chakalaka, where diners can order off a menu including kudu (a kind of antelope) carpaccio, zebra and ostrich; and Vivat Bacchus, whose South African dishes include crocodile and springbok.
People are constantly seeking to discover new foods, new restaurants, new culinary experiences, but the traditional species have reached their limitation on meeting this demand, said Bora. It has to go beyond the current beef, chicken, and pork dishes, and it has to come without the expense of nature.
Primeval is planning tastings in London and New York. But while the initial launch might focus on high-end culinary trend-setters, ultimately Primeval Foods believes it will expand on a larger scale and even sees potential to hit the supermarket shelves.
The goal is to become globally mainstream, one way or another. We want to be in every corner of the world, at least with a product and/or species. We start with restaurants because chefs have the ability to create amazing foods and culinary experiences. We believe that will accelerate consumer acceptance, Bora told us.
Of course, regulation remains a significant hurdle for the cellular meat sector in Europe, the US and UK. To date, the only food safety authority to greenlight the sale of cultivated meat globally remains Singapore. But Bora believes this is a technology that has come of age.
I believe all countries are welcoming cultivated meat as an idea, but nobody wants to head the regulation (except Singapore, of course). In general, what we see in novel technologies is that when a leader country (economically, culturally, and legally) heads the regulation, others will follow them by adapting the framework. I think we will see that when the US regulates the industry, he predicted.
In terms of next steps, Primeval Foods is currently working on the development of cell lines for new species.

The Sundarbans, which means beautiful forest, is one of the most vulnerable areas in the country to the impacts of climate change. It is one of the wildest places left on Earth: a biodiversity hotspot and a complex tidal network of waterways and islands that is only accessible by boat. It is a delicate ecosystem that is under pressure from human development and the climate crisis, which is threatening the ecology of the Sundarbans. | Mohammad Rakibul Hasan.
Sea level rise is one of the most significant threats to the Sundarbans forest. | Mohammad Rakibul Hasan.
The impacts of climate change on the Sundarbans forest are impacting the lives of people in the surrounding areas. The forest is a significant source of livelihood for many people in the region, who rely on it for fishing, agriculture, and other activities. As the forest is damaged by sea level rise and extreme weather events, these people will also be affected by food and water insecurity and the loss of their homes and livelihoods. | Mohammad Rakibul Hasan.
The Mangrove Photography Awards is organized by the Mangrove Action Project who says that less than half of half the worlds original mangrove forest cover remains. 
Photographs of mangroves and contests related to them play a multifaceted role in advocating for the conservation and protection of these critical coastal forests, says one of the judges Fulvio Eccardi. 
They raise awareness, educate, inspire action, and contribute to the scientific understanding of these ecosystems, all of which are vital for their long-term survival and the well-being of coastal communities around the world.",,PetaPixel,Bengal Tiger,,,0.1,0.9,"Wildlife, Forests, Climate and Energy, Governance",Other,"Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris ssp. tigris), Other",English

And that a majority close to 2,600 are in the Kaziranga National Park in Assam? What this means is that this is the park that is your best bet to see this elusive animal in India.
Thriving topography

My first visit to the park, however, happened to be on a heavily overcast day with a steady drizzle that almost meant I was not going to be on the safari. However, the rain gods decided to be kind and soon I hopped on to the safari Jeep on my maiden safari in India's north-east region. The Park itself is stunning with grasslands, wetlands, and forests that has made it a UNESCO World Heritage site. Established in 1905, the Park occupies 430 sq. km on the banks of the Brahmaputra River making it an important habitat for the rhinos.
 The big five in the Kaziranga National Park include the Rhino, Tiger, Elephant, Asiatic Wild Buffalo, and The Eastern Swamp Deer. (Photo: Bindu Gopal Rao)
The meaning of Kaziranga incidentally is 'where the mountain goat has water' in the local Karbi tribe. The semi evergreen and deciduous forest here is peppered with swamps and tall grass that adds to its overall allure. This also means that the park has varied flora and fauna and the big five here include the rhino, tiger, elephant, Asiatic wild buffalo, and the Eastern Swamp deer.
Sightings and more
The best way to look for the rhino is to book a Jeep safari that usually lasts for about three hours. The Park also offers elephant safaris that are for an hour and need advance booking. The one-horned rhino is of course the biggest draw here. On cloudy days, the challenge of seeing them can be compounded as well.

It was over an hour into my safari that I finally spotted a couple of them as they emerged from a water body. It is interesting to note that the greater one horned rhino is the largest species of rhinos and is endemic to India, parts of Nepal and Pakistan. The rhino numbers have plummeted in the past as they have been victims of poaching in the past. Hence there has been a concerted effort to conserve the species with anti-poaching and monitoring cells in place within their wildlife corridors. This rhino is a distinct animal with its single black horn and greyish brown textured body that has skin folds. The adult male rhinos are usually solitary and they have defined home ranges that are not actually territorial. The animals graze on grass and feed on leaves, shrubs, aquatic plants, and fruits. If you are lucky, you can spot them in smaller herds. Look out for the watch towers from where you can get a birds eye view of the park.

As the safari Jeep navigates the path, keep an eye out for the other species here. Being classified as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International, the Park is rich in avian life as well. Birds like the great Indian hornbill, the white-winged wood duck, the elusive Bengal florican, Greater Adjutant Stork, Pallas's Fish Eagle, Indian roller, Asian barred owlet, and Black-necked Stork among others. In fact, there have been over 450 species recorded here. You can also opt for guided bird-watching tours which will help you spot several rare species. There are several birding spots like marshes, woodland areas, water bodies and oxbow lakes that provide an excellent habitat for birds. In all, a visit to Kaziranga National Park is a great way to celebrate the diversity of wildlife and is a great way to understand the elusive greater one horned rhinoceros.

Even ""terrestrial"" wildlife, including rhinos and elephants, can depend on habitat features created and maintained by rivers.

[+] Washington D.C.
Jeff Opperman
When I heard that the Kennedy Centers River Run festival featured a set of life-size statues of rhinoceroses outside the venue, I thought, Why rhinos? Why not a river animal like a hippo or river dolphin?
But then I realized I was making the same oversight that I often (politely, hopefully) correct in others: constraining the set of animals that depend on rivers for their habitat to those animals that actually spend most of their time in the water.
Its an easy mistake to make. After all, rhinos may occasionally cross a river or lumber in to cool off, but no one will confuse them for an aquatic animal. And given that most readers will have seen photos of rhinos in dusty savannas or verdant grasslands, I can understand people balking at the idea of a rhino as a river animal.
Nevertheless, rhinocerosesand particularly the species featured at the Kennedy Center, the greater one-horned rhinocan be thought of as river-dependent animals.
Two concepts underpin how rhinos, and other terrestrial animals, depend on rivers for their habitat.
First, in arid and semi-arid regions, rivers support a distinct habitat type: the water flowing in a river maintains a high water table in the land surrounding the channel, resulting in a ribbon of lush vegetation that winds through an otherwise sparse landscape.
For example, see the photos below of the riparian corridor of the Tana River which flows through the arid region of eastern Kenya (riparian means adjacent to a river).
The Tana River supports a ribbon of green vegetation (forests and wetlands) that flows through the ... [+] arid landscape of eastern Kenya. This river corridor provides critical habitat for many large mammals and other species. 
Google Earth
These narrow, verdant habitats are a small part of the overall landscape, but their importance to wildlife can be vastly disproportionate to their extent. For example, the Tana River corridor supports two primate species found nowhere else in the world, along with higher concentrations of large mammals compared to the surrounding landscape.
Left: The sparsely vegetated landscape of arid eastern Kenya, with the river corridor of the Tana ... [+] River in the background. Right: The lush riparian forest of the Tana River.
Jeff Opperman
Similarly, a study in the semi-arid Inyo Mountains of California found that although riparian vegetation made up only 1% of the overall area, more than 70% of all vertebrate species depended on these narrow bands of green vegetation for at least part of the year.
A riparian corridor in the semi-arid Inyo Mountains of California. 
Google Earth
In regions with distinct wet and dry seasons, the riparian corridors serve as refuges during the dry times.
During the rainy season, the whole landscape supports a flush of new growth, and large herbivores can roam widely to access food.
But during the dry season, vegetation across much of the landscape becomes desiccated and overgrazed and large animals tend to congregate in the still-green habitats along river corridors, where plant growth is maintained by the high water tables supported by river flows.
See photos below of the area surrounding the Zambezi River in southern Africa. During the rainy season, the whole landscape is green. But during the dry season, the only green vegetation to be found is within the narrow riparian corridor and associated wetlands. During this time of year, many animals congregate along the rivers, wetlands and riparian forests, where food can still be found.

Google Earth
Further, these distinct habitatsthese ribbons of green that traverse the landscapeserve important functions for large mammals that need to migrate. WWF wildlife biologist Robin Naidoo, who studies how large mammals move across landscapes in southern Africa, says ""permanent waterbodies like rivers are essential dry season habitat for migrating mammals such as elephant and buffalo, while seasonal rivers and other water sources that fill up during the rains support the mass movements of wildlife that are among nature's most inspiring spectacles.""
But rivers dont just sit back and passively support different habitat types. No, rivers work hard to actively create distinct habitat types. This is the second concept that explains how rivers are critical to the habitat needs of terrestrial wildlife.
During floods, a healthy river can move across its floodplaina phenomenon known as channel migration. When this occurs, the river removes existing habitatsthrough the erosion of islands, river banks and forestsand creates new habitats by depositing sediment. Vegetation begins to grow on these fresh sediment deposits, creating new habitats.

The greater one-horned rhinocerosfound only in India and Nepaldepends primarily on grasslands within river corridors and floodplains for their habitat. They feed on the grass and use the dense vegetation as cover. Over time, grasslands tend to be replaced by forests. But in a river corridor with a rambunctious river, the process of channel migration will continually remove old habitats and reset them, maintaining a sufficient extent of grassland over time.
This process can be seen in the photos below of the Karnali River in Nepal. The first photo shows the river corridor in 2001 with a mosaic of channels and forested islands. The second photo shows the same location in 2011 in the aftermath of a large flood: islands and forest have been removed, and there are large areas of freshly deposited sediment. The third photo, from 2020, shows how grassland has grown on these fresh sediments. This is the habitat type that the greater one-horned rhinoceros depends upon.

Google Earth
These static photos dont quite do justice to this dynamic process of meander migration removing habitats and creating new habitats that are crucial to rhinos. Check out these Google Earth Engine timelapse animations of the Narayani River in Chitwan National Park (Nepal) and the Brahmaputra River in Kaziranga National Park (India)two key areas for the greater one-horned rhino.
The dynamic process of habitat creation also reveals how terrestrial animals such as rhinos can be vulnerable to dam development. While we typically think of species such as salmon or the Mekong giant catfish being vulnerable to the disruptions caused by dams, rhinos are vulnerable as well. A proposed hydropower dam on the Karnali River, for example, could reduce flood levels, resulting in a less exuberant river and reduced rates of channel migration.
In fact, rivers that support complex habitat corridorswith a mosaic of channels and islands and habitat types ranging from young grassland to mature forestoften transition to simple, single-thread channels after they are dammed. The post-dam rivers lack the energy to change the habitats around them (see image below).
Changes in the river corridor around the Willamette River (Oregon) from 1910, prior to dam ... [+] construction, to 1988, revealing a dramatic simplification of the river corridor from a mosaic of multiple channels and islands to a primarily single-thread channel with far fewer islands and reduced habitat complexity. 
Figure from Dykaar and Wigington (2000)
Many people would be surprised to learn that, if the proposed major dam on the Karnali were to be built, one of its major environmental impacts would be the loss of rhino habitat dozens of kilometers downstream.
The statues of the greater one-horned rhinos, the largest of all rhino species, at the Kennedy Center were titled Survivorsevocative of a species with a population that declined by more than 90%, reaching a low of just 200 individuals at the turn of the 20th century. But conservation efforts led to an impressive recovery from that low point, and now more than 4000 individuals can be found in India and Nepal.
With the species now downlisted from Endangered to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species, it is one Asias greatest success stories and a true survivor, says Nilanga Jayasinghe, Manager for Asian Species Conservation at WWF.
I got a chance to meet the artist who made Survivors, Roberto Fabelo of Cuba, and I asked him why the lead rhino statue was wrapped in a red bow. He told me, They are a gift to the world.

A 150-pound bottle-fed calf is an impressive success story and a noteworthy benchmark in our unprecedented breeding program for species that face so many threats in their native rangelands.
Dan Beetem, The Wilds Director of Animal Management, said that as the calf grows stronger, the team is working on a plan to integrate her with the herd so that despite the special attention she is receiving her human caregivers, she will have the opportunity to live and develop as a rhino. Calves usually weigh more than 100 pounds at birth and gain a few pounds every day. An adult greater one-horned rhino can reach 4,000 to 6,000 pounds.  
The good news is, we have several young female rhinos with whom she can interact and learn how to be a rhino, Beetem said. She will continue to be bottle fed for several months. Mother-raised rhinos will typically nurse for almost a year and a half. We expect that she will be ready to start working on reintroduction to the herd once those animals are back in the barns for the winter.
The calf is the 10th greater one-horned rhino born at The Wilds. Her father is 22-year-old Suru, who was born at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in 2000. He came to The Wilds from Miami Zoo in 2021 per a breeding recommendation through the Species Survival Plan® (SSP), a program coordinated by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) to maximize the genetic diversity and increase the population sustainability of threatened and endangered species in professional care. This is his fourth calf.
Each greater one-horned rhino birth is a significant achievement for a species that nearly went extinct during the 20th century. The Wilds is home to six greater one-horned rhinos and is one of only 19 AZA-accredited facilities in North America to care for this species.
The Wilds is also home to 17 southern white rhinos and has had a total of 30 white rhino births since 2004, with the most recent being a female born on September 23. The calf was born in the pasture to 10-year-old Anan, who was born at The Wilds in 2009. This is her fifth calf. The father is 25-year-old Kengele, who was born at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. He came to The Wilds in 2012. This is his ninth calf.
The Wilds is the only facility outside of Africa with white rhinos born four and five generations removed from their wild-born ancestors. White rhino calves are born after a gestation of 16 months and they can grow to be 5,000 pounds and 6 feet tall at their shoulder.
Our successful rhino breeding programs are a valuable insurance policy for these animals that face grave dangers in their native ranges, Smith said.
In addition to challenges such as habitat degradation, poachers sell rhino horns for ornamental or traditional medicinal purposes even though there are no scientifically proven health benefits for their use. The horns are made of keratin  the same substance that makes up fingernails and hair.
As part of its continued commitment to protecting these species, The Wilds has teamed up with the Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) at the Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden and other partner research facilities to form the American Institute of Rhinoceros Science (AIRS), a model for saving species with science ex situ (which means off site or outside natural habitat). The AIRS operations are located at The Wilds, and the initiative was made possible by a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). This collaboration strives to save rhinos through science by researching their physical condition, dietary needs, reproduction, and behavioral and environmental factors all in an effort to maximize their wellbeing in professional care.
Rhinos were not the only significant births at The Wilds this fall, however. For the first time since 2017, a Persian onager was born. New mother Jemma is 8 years old, and the father is 15-year-old Mandrake, who was born at The Wilds in 2007.
The foal is the 34th onager born at The Wilds, which boasts having nearly half of the species population in North America. While this foal was naturally bred, The Wilds worked with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) to produce the first Persian onager born from artificial insemination in 2010. There are only 700 onagers estimated to live in the wild today, mostly in Iran.
The adult Persian onager, a subspecies of Asiatic wild ass, typically weigh about 500 pounds and stand about 50 inches at the shoulder. Beetem said that the timing of the onager birth was well-considered as part of a plan to best support the species with such a small population.
Careful consideration must be made to ensure genetic diversity when breeding a population with such few numbers, Beetem said.
With this birth, there are 17 onagers at The Wilds, and a total of 36 in professional care in North America.
Guests who visit The Wilds may have the opportunity to see some of the babies in their barns during the Winter Wildside Tours, which begin for the season on November 1. Winter Wildside Tours are presented by AEP Ohio.

The southern white rhino calf arrived safely into the world on the evening of Sunday 23rd October, to mother Meru, following a calm and relaxed labour.
The birth was a welcome surprise to the Knowsley Safari team as white rhinos have a gestation period of 16 to 18 months and Meru had past her expected due date so it was thought that the pregnancy may not have progressed.
The calf has spent her first few days with mum Meru in the warmth and quiet of the rhino house, and already weighs a whopping 10 stone. Visitors to the safari are expected to get a first glimpse of her over the coming days when shell venture out into the outdoor enclosure, with mum, for the very first time.
The new calf is the 22nd be born at Knowsley Safari and is another success of the extensive European Association of Zoos and Aquarias (EAZA) Ex-situ breeding programme.  The 100-acre habitat at Knowsley Safari provides plenty of space for its crash of eight white rhinos and it has been very successful breeding this species and has made a significant contribution to the programme.
Mum Meru who arrived at the safari in 1996, when she was two years old, from her birthplace of Edinburgh Zoo - gave birth to the last baby rhino to be born at Knowsley Safari back in 2018. She will nurse the new calf for around a year so visitors can expect to see her sticking close to her curious offspring as she explores her new surroundings and is introduced to the rest of the crash.
The calf is as yet unnamed, and the safari will be asking for help to name her soon.
Knowsley Safaris Animal Operations Manager Chris Smart said: ""This is yet another very exciting step forward in the conservation of this species and we are over the moon to welcome our 22nd southern white rhino calf to be born here.
As a very experienced mother, Meru has quickly adapted to being a mum again, and her calf is already up and about. Each day that passes, she becomes a little more active and is already running around shes certainly very curious and confident.
Her arrival was unexpected until very recently. Despite previously confirming the pregnancy, Merus due date past so we assumed she was no longer was. We didnt see any signs of pregnancy until just a few weeks before calving, when she was in its latter stages.  The keepers were keeping a very close eye on her and spotted the signs of the impending birth last weekend and prepared the rhino house with a deep layer of straw to help the calf to stand which typically happens just an hour later. It was such a happy turn of events.
The whole team here is absolutely delighted. Mum and calf have bonded wonderfully and have been showing us all of the right signs. Numbers of these rhinos have been so low and every single addition to the EAZA Ex-situ breeding programme is celebrated.
Were thrilled to play our part in the fight to prevent their extinction and are so proud of the great work were doing to safeguard the future of this species. Its amazing to welcome another little one.

getty
Next week the Supreme Court of Nepal is hearing a case focused on whether to move forward with construction of hydropower dams on the Karnali River, the countrys last major river that remains undammed. The Courts decision will go a long way toward resolving a seemingly irreconcilable conflict between two national objectives:
(1) Growing the Nepalese economy with the abundant low-carbon electricity generated from hydropower dams on its rivers;
(2) Maintaining healthy, natural rivers crucial to a range of cultural traditions and environmental resources valuable in their own right, but also underpinning the significant economic potential of nature tourism.
Tough choice, right? Yesexcept these are not irreconcilable aims.
While not easy, they can be reconciled if tackled at the right scale of geography. The Supreme Court decision could help move the debate away from the scale of conflict and toward the scale of solutions.
And at that latter scale, well see that Nepal can have both abundant, low-carbon electricity and a healthy, free-flowing Karnali River.
To explain how, lets start with the basics. At heart, this is a debate about how best to use the bounty produced from the combination of two key ingredients: elevation and water. The Karnali River basin has these ingredients in abundance, as does the entire country of Nepal.
Elevation and plentiful water are the fundamental components for hydropower and, in fact, Nepal generates more than 95% of its electricity from hydropower. The country is also planning to increase its generation capacity several times over in the next few decades and also looks to hydropower for nearly all of that expansion.
But elevation and abundant water are also primary ingredients for a number of other benefits. Rivers coursing off the Tibetan plateau carve dramatic canyons and have been viewed as holy entities for millennia. In the valleys below, these rivers replenish the groundwater under floodplains and they deliver sediment and nutrients to renew the productivity of lowland agriculture and fisheries. They form long networks of connected and complex channels for migratory fish and, when they surge out onto the plains of southern Nepal, they have the energy to create habitat features essential for wildlife, ranging from rhinos to river dolphins.
And thus, given all they create when mixed together, water and elevation are also key ingredients that underpin nature tourism: trekking, fishing, and rafting.
These diverse valuesspanning hydropower to rhinos to raftingthat emerge from the alchemy of elevation and water can co-exist at the scale of a nation or even at the scale of a river basin. They have a harder time co-existing at the scale of a single river.
A river dammed for hydropower will generally become inaccessible to migratory fish. Hydropower built in mountain canyons generally creates considerable lengths of snaking reservoirs of still water or, conversely, stretches that are nearly de-watered (due to diversions). Either change, when superimposed on a stretch of whitewater rapids, is incompatible with world-class rafting.
These conflicting futures for the Karnali River are at the center of the current Supreme Court case. The Karnali is one of the longest free-flowing rivers in the Himalayas and the last of the big rivers in Nepal without dams. In its current form, the river offers some of the best rafting and kayaking in Asia and provides habitat for migratory fish, including the iconic megafish, the golden masheer. As it flows across lowland floodplains, the energetic Karnali carves out a complex mosaic of habitats, including islands of grassland and oxbow lakes that are essential for Greater one-horned rhinoceros. That lower reach is also home to critically endangered gharials and the largest population of river dolphins in Nepal.

These diverse environmental and cultural values have inspired government, communities, and organizations in the province that shares the rivers name to pursue a vision of a Green Karnali. Their plans propose a healthy Karnali River serving as the heart of regional tourism based on natural and cultural assets that are becoming increasingly rare across Asia, and the rest of the world.
Securing a Green Karnali could position the province to capture a larger share of the increasing global demand for tourism focused on natural and cultural resources. Karnali Province could follow in the footsteps of Costa Rica, which protected much of its forests and rivers and is now synonymous with nature-based tourism, representing nearly 13% of its Gross Domestic Product (pre-pandemic) and its largest source of foreign exchange.
But the Karnali also holds great potential for hydropower, with several large dams proposed for the mainstem river.
The opposing visions of a Green Karnali versus a harnessed Karnali now meet in the Supreme Court, as the Court hears a lawsuit brought by river advocates on the basis of Nepals constitutional guarantee of citizens rights to a healthy environment.
As noted above, when such conflicts collide in the arena of a single river, the contest becomes a zero-sum game. But if the arena can be expanded, say to the whole country, then a broader range of solutions emerges and legitimate win-win, balanced outcomes become possible.
I was part of a research team that explored this relationship between expanding geographic scale and expanding potential for achieving balanced solutions. We examined a broad range of options for Nepal to meet its future power demands with low-carbon, low-cost electricity and then asked, among these, are there some options that would allow Nepal to also maintain most of its current wealth of other values from rivers?
For this research, a group of Nepali experts defined a High Conservation Value River and then these rivers were mapped across the country. Not surprisingly, the Karnali emerged as one of the highest ranked rivers based on the experts criteria and the data compiled to evaluate the countrys river systems.
Then an energy research team from the University of California, Berkeley, developed a sophisticated model of the Nepali grid and simulated options for meeting projected electricity demand in 2040. The model selected among a pool of potential investments for generation, storage and transmission projects to build a functioning grid; the variable that changed among these options was cost.
Using this model, we could run simulations based on different policy choices, such as choices to avoid new hydropower dams in certain regions or on certain rivers. The model output would tell us how much these policy choices would affect the cost of Nepals future power system.
For example, we found that avoiding building hydropower dams in national parks (about one-quarter of Nepals proposed dams are within park boundaries) would only increase system costs by 2% (essentially an imperceptible rounding error given that energy development must deal with a range of cost uncertainties that are far greater than this difference).
Most relevant for the current Supreme Court case, we also examined the policy option of leaving the Karnali main stem undammed.
The result? Avoiding building hydropower dams on the main stem Karnali would have essentially zero influence on power system costs for Nepal. This outcome is possible because: (1) there is such a large pool of potential hydropower dams in Nepal that there are many other similar hydropower options on other rivers, including those that are already dammed as well as tributaries of the Karnali; and (2) wind and solar PVnow the cheapest forms of electricity generation in much of the worldare becoming increasingly cost competitive in Nepal.
This research provides a very optimistic insight for the people of Nepal. Their country can maintain the diverse values of the Karnaliwith the river serving as the centerpiece of an economically valuable Green Karnali destinationand power its economy with low cost, low carbon electricity.
This national-scale approach to balancing hydropower with healthy rivers would allow Nepal to demonstrate a sustainable future, with an energy system that is both clean and green.",,Forbes,Greater One-horned Rhinoceros,,,0.9,0.9,"Wildlife, Freshwater, Climate and Energy, Governance",Other,"Greater One-horned Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), South Asian River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica), Other",English

Babur crosses the Jumna threatened by an aquatic monster while entertained by musicians. Artist Khem. Northern India, 1590-93 (Or. 3714, f.504v)
The emperor Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur (1483-1530) is most famous as the founder of the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent which he conquered and ruled from 1526. Driven from Central Asia while still a youth, he took Kabul in 1504 and made it the centre of his kingdom before moving east and defeating Ibrahim Lodi, Sultan of Delhi, at Panipat in 1526 and Rana Sanga of Mewar at Khanwa in 1527.
In between intense military activities, Babur somehow managed to find time to write his memoirs (Vqit-i Bbur). In these Babur records his ruthless victories, but at the same time writes unpretentiously of his personal feelings, revealing himself to be a scholar, a poet and a keen naturalist. Histories were already an established literary genre by this time as were encyclopedias which recorded the wonders of the universe. However this autobiographical record of Baburs is unique with observations based largely on his own experiences.
Originally written in Chaghatai Turki, his memoirs are arranged chronologically by year and were translated several times into Persian but most famously in 1589 at the request of his grandson Akbar (r. 15561605) by Akbar's chief minister Abd al-Rahim Khan-i khanan. The British Library is fortunate in possessing one of four known imperial copies of Abd al-Rahims translation which were all made at the end of the 16th century and were illustrated by the most famous artists of the time. Our copy is datable to the early 1590s on stylistic grounds and presently has 143 paintings out of an original 183. Since it was possible to display only one opening in our exhibition, I have taken this opportunity to write further about Babur's section on the animals, birds and plants of Hindustan.
Elephants. Northern India, 1590-93 (Or. 3714, f.378r)
The elephant, Babur tells us, is native to the borders of the Kalpi country (present day Uttar Pradesh) and further east. It is a noble creature and understands what people say to it and obeys their commands. The bigger it is, the more valuable. Babur adds here that in some islands elephants are reputed to measure more than 10 gaz (yard) high, but he has never seen them larger than 4 or 5. Elephants can carry immense loads, three or four can pull carts that would take four or five hundred men to pull. However, they eat a lot! One elephant eats as much as two strings of camels.
The Rhinoceros. Artist, Makar. Northern India, 1590-93 (Or. 3714, f.379r)
The rhinoceros (karg) is also a large animal equivalent in size to three buffaloes, but the story that it can lift an elephant on its horn is false. It has one horn on its nose and its hide is very thick. It is ferocious and unlike the elephant cannot be tamed.
Monkeys. Artist, Shyam. Northern India, 1590-93 (Or. 3714, f. 382v)
Babur mentions several different kinds of monkeys (maymn  called bndar in Hindustani): one which is yellow with a white face and short tail, which is exported and taught to do tricks, another, (langr) is larger with white hair, a black face. and long tail. Another comes from the islands which is coloured not exactly blue nor yellow but strangely, he writes, has a permanently erect penis which never becomes limp.
Parrots. Artist, Kesu Gujarati. Northern India, 1590-93 (Or. 3714, f. 384v)
Babur describes many kinds of parrots. Of one particular kind he recounts that he had formerly believed parrots could only repeat what they had been taught, but that recently one of his close attendants, Abu 'l-Qasim Jalayir, had told him that when he had covered his parrots cage, the parrot said Uncover me. I cant breathe.
Adjutant stork. Artist, Dhanu. Northern India, 1590-93 (Or 3714, f. 389v)
One of the birds that lives in water and on the banks of rivers, the adjutant stork (ding) had the wingspan of about the size of a man and no feathers on its head or neck. Its back and breast were white. Babur had been familiar with a tamed adjutant in Kabul which would catch meat when it was thrown at it. Once it swallowed a six layered shoe, and another time a whole chicken complete with wings and feathers.
The great bat (chamgadar), is as large as an owl with a head like a puppy which hangs upside down on the branch of a tree at night. Artist, Shankar Gujarati. Northern India, 1590-93 (Or. 3714, f. 392v)
And finally, of alligators and crocodiles:
An alligator (literally water-lion). Artist, Dhanu. Northern India, 15903 (Or 3714, f. 393v)
Babur writes: one of the aquatic creatures is the alligator (shir-i b water-lion) which lives in the black waters and resembles a lizard. In our manuscript, the artist Dhanu, who had possibly never seen an alligator or was at least unfamiliar with the Persian word for it, interprets the word literally and paints a lion attacking a bull, a familiar motif in Persian art. He was obviously puzzled, so to clarify that it was a water-lion, he added a ship in the top left corner. Babur also described dolphins, crocodiles and an especially large crocodile, the gharial, which seized three or four soldiers between Ghazipur and Benares.
The gharial. Artist, Sarwan. Northern India, 15903 (Or. 3714, f. 394r)

That may explain why I was so pleased a few months ago to read a short article in a Syracuse newspaper about something both unexpected and quite unreservedly lovely: this past July, in the remote Moose River Plains Wild Forest, in the Adirondacks, a young botanist named Erik Danielson found the largest Eastern white pine known to exist. Indeed, it is the largest tree of any kind known in that great wilderness, and ever since I read about it Id been hoping he might be persuaded to take me for a look. Earlier this month, with a dusting of snow on the ground, he led a small group of enthusiasts on a two-hour bushwhack into the forest.
Danielson, aged thirty-three, is a self-taught botanist who works for the Western New York Land Conservancy, helping to, among other things, identify rare and endangered plant communities. Im particularly interested in mosses and liverworts, he said, and, indeed, wed barely left the dirt road between Indian Lake and Inlet, New York, before he was bent over a carpet of green. But, in his spare time, Danielson is a big-tree hunter, at work for the Gathering Growth Foundation, on a book about the big trees of New York. Hes part of a small band that has systematically sought out the patches of old-growth forest that were left across the East after the rapacious logging of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries. Ive known some of these sleuths for yearsI spent a pleasant day a quarter century ago with one of Danielsons mentors, another autodidact tree-lover named Bob Leverett, measuring white pines in a state park in the Berkshires. Ive visited forest patches in the Carolinas, Vermont, and New Hampshire, but much of the remaining Eastern old growth is confined to the Adirondacks, the vast and sparsely populated quarter of New York that rises north of Saratoga, south of Quebec, and between the Mohawk and St. Lawrence Rivers, Lake Champlain, and Lake Ontario. Though the region is high and cold, with a short growing season, its also protected and empty, as long as you stay away from the scenic High Peaks around Lake Placid. Ive often wandered there for days on end seeing no one.
Danielson was alerted to this particular corner of the Adirondacks by a hunter, Matt Kane, who posted a picture of a giant white pine on a Facebook group this year. Kane had been researching the logging history of the area, which came into state hands in the last decades of the nineteenth century, when it was still largely virgin forest. In 1950, a huge stormstill known as the big blowdowntoppled most of the trees there, and though the area was officially protected wilderness, the state allowed a controversial salvage logging of downed trees. For the first half of the hike, we followed, in places, an overgrown former logging road. Danielson has tools that his predecessors lacked, most notably lidar scansbasically, a Light Detection and Ranging aircraft pulses a laser down at the earth, measuring distances so accurately that it can build a 3-D picture of any area. I was processing the canopy height model, and you could see that there had to be trees that were a hundred and forty to a hundred and sixty feet tall, Danielson said. In the Adirondacks, thats very tall. And what made it really exciting was that it was a large areait looked like five hundred or five hundred and fifty acres. Usually what you find are very small clusters such as the eight-acre Elders Grove, near Paul Smiths College, where the states onetime tallest pine, Tree 103, fell in 2021.
Sometimes, as with the Elders Grove pine, these giant trees are situated conveniently near a road. Not in this case. We clambered along the remains of the logging road until we came to a sizable brook; you could plot a theoretical course across the rocks, but, as is often the case, theory succumbed to practice, and I slipped and got my boots wet (thank science for Gore-Tex). Across the brook, the forest began to deepen, and so did Danielsons story (though it gave way at regular intervals to short seminars on bronze grape fern, which comes in two forms, and Northeastern sedge, which looks a lot like yellow sedge except for some details). He was describing his July expedition to us. On the first day, he found a very big white pine, but barely had time to catalogue it. It felt so remote, he said. Usually, there are some signs of hunters, but here I didnt even see a beer can. He hit on a small brook, and followed it up through a quiet forest, scrambling across giant deadfallsnurse logs sprouting hundreds of seedlings. I was in a kind of ecstatic state, especially after I saw that waterfall over there, he said. Then I glimpsed an extra-large trunk through the trees and, as I got closer, it wasnt getting any smaller. Foresters, charmingly, measure the size of trees by D.B.H., or diameter at breast height, which is calculated from the circumference. He added, When I wrapped my tape around it, it was 16.39 feetone of the largest ever measured for a white pine. (This trees D.B.H. is more than five feet.) But base circumference does not make a big treeindeed, most really wide white pines are comparatively squat. Looking up at this one, though, I could tell it was tall, Danielson said. He crossed a gully to a small glade where he could get a clear view of the crown and, using a hypsometer, measured the trees height at a hundred and fifty-one feet and six inches.
Thats not the tallest pine we know aboutlast year, Danielson, not surprisingly, had measured the post-Tree 103 New York State height champion, on the other side of the Adirondacks, near Lake George, at a hundred and seventy-four feet. But many tall trees, including that one, are relatively skinny. This Moose River Plains pine, which he named Bigfoot, is a solid pole heading up into the sky. He could tell that, even at eighty feet, it was still forty inches in diameter, and he was able to conservatively estimate its volume (of the trunk and the main branches) at fourteen hundred and fifty cubic feetreportedly, a record for the species. Indeed, Danielson says there are fewer than a dozen known, living, and verifiable specimens of white pine larger than a thousand cubic feet.",,The New Yorker,Tree Fern,,,0.0,0.85,"Climate and Energy, Forests",Other,Other,English

In the Victorian era, big game hunting saw a meteoric rise in popularity, coinciding with Britain’s colonization of numerous regions in the so-called “Scramble for Africa” and the advent of more accurate firearms that galvanized a fashion for amassing “exotic” trophies. Sometimes intended for museums, specimens were often bound for private collections, and creatures that roamed the vast African continent were considered particularly attractive prizes.
Known as the Big Five, the lion, leopard, black rhinoceros, African bush elephant, and African buffalo were considered the most difficult species to hunt on foot. Today, many of these animals are vulnerable and endangered and must be protected in nature reserves in order to prevent being unlawfully hunted to extinction. In his forthcoming book The New Big 5, photographer Graeme Green wants to flip the narrative: Shooting with a camera, not a gun.
The New Big 5 is the culmination of a three-year project celebrating the remarkable multiplicity of Earth’s inhabitants, which also aims to raise awareness of the fragility of their existence as their habitats are increasingly threatened due to the climate crisis. In April 2020, Green asked people around the world to suggest what animals they most enjoyed seeing in photographs. More than 3,000 people voted for their favorites, and the list includes species found in Asia and North America, too: elephants, tigers, gorillas, polar bears, and lions. Family life is a particular focus, emphasizing the universally tender relationships of parents rearing their babies.
With more than a million species at risk of extinction worldwide, Green wanted the project “to focus attention on all of the world’s incredible wildlife, large and small, and the urgent need to act together globally to save these animals, our planet, and ourselves.” The book brings together more than 200 photographs by 146 photographers from around the world and contains numerous interviews and essays by some of the foremost conservationists, scientists, and activists working today.
Scheduled for release on April 4, you can pre-order a copy on Bookshop, and visit the project’s website to learn more.

395,,New ancient 'marine crocodile' discovered on UK's Jurassic Coast -- and it's one of the oldest specimens of its type ever found,A new study has uncovered a new thalattosuchian -- an ancient 'sister' of modern-day crocodiles' ancestors.,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/01/230130130515.htm,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,2023-01-30T18:05:15Z,"A new study has uncovered a new thalattosuchian -- an ancient 'sister' of modern-day crocodiles' ancestors.The discovery of Turnersuchus hingleyae follows an impressive unearthing of fossils on the Jurassic Coast, in Dorset, UK, including part of the head, backbone, and limbs. In fact, the find at the Charmouth Mudstone Formation was so successful, Turnersuchus is the only complete enough thalattosuchian of its age -- dating back to the Early Jurassic, Pliensbachian period, around 185 million years ago -- to be named to date.
Published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, experts state the discovery of this new predator helps fill a gap in the fossil record and suggests that thalattosuchians, with other crocodyliforms, should have originated around the end of the Triassic period -- around 15 million years further back in time than when Turnersuchus lived.
""We should now expect to find more thalattosuchians of the same age as Turnersuchus as well as older,"" states co-author Dr. Eric Wilberg, Assistant Professor at the Department of Anatomical Sciences, at Stony Brook University.
""In fact, during the publication of our paper, another paper was published describing a thalattosuchian skull discovered in the roof of a cave in Morocco from the Hettangian/Sinemurian (the time periods preceding the Pliensbachian where Turnersuchus was found), which corroborates this idea. I expect we will continue to find more older thalattosuchians and their relatives. Our analyses suggest that thalattosuchians likely first appeared in the Triassic and survived the end-Triassic mass extinction.""
However, no digs have found thalattosuchians in Triassic rocks yet, which means there is a ghost lineage (a period during which we know a group must have existed, but we haven't yet recovered fossil evidence). Until the discovery of Turnersuchus, this ghost lineage extended from the end of the Triassic until the Toarcian, in the Jurassic, ""but now we can reduce the ghost lineage by a few million years"" the expert team states.
Thalattosuchians are referred to colloquially as 'marine crocodiles' or 'sea crocodiles', despite the fact they are not members of Crocodylia, but are more distantly related. Some thalattosuchians became very well adapted to life in the oceans, with short limbs modified into flippers, a shark-like tail fin, salt glands, and potentially the ability to give live birth (rather than lay eggs).
Turnersuchus is interesting as much of these recognized thalattosuchian features had yet to fully evolve. It lived in the Jurassic Ocean and preyed on marine wildlife. And, due to its relatively long, slender snout, would have looked similar in appearance to the currently living gharial crocodiles, which are found in all the major river systems of the northern Indian subcontinent.
""However,"" co-author Dr. Pedro Godoy, from the University of São Paulo in Brazil says, ""unlike crocodiles, this approximately 2-meter-long predator lived purely in coastal marine habitats. And though their skulls look superficially similar to modern gharials, they were constructed quite differently.""
Thalattosuchians had particularly large supratemporal fenestrae -- a region of the skull housing jaw muscles. This suggests that Turnersuchus and other thalattosuchians possessed enlarged jaw muscles that likely enabled fast bites; most of their likely prey were fast-moving fish or cephalopods. It's possible too, just as in modern-day crocodiles, that the supratemporal region of Turnersuchus had a thermoregulatory function -- to help buffer brain temperature.
Its name 'Turner'suchus 'hingley'ae originates from those who discovered and donated the specimen to the Lyme Regis Museum: Paul Turner and Lizzie Hingley who discovered the fossil in 2017. The ending ""suchus,"" is the Latinized form of ""soukhos,"" Greek for crocodile. The specimen is currently on display at the Lyme Regis Museum in Lyme Regis, Dorset, England.
The excavation also involved colleagues from the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre, who helped to unite the parts. These cliffs and the beach on the South Coast of England site have become synonymous for such finds with the discovery of ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, as well as the best preserved and most complete dinosaur found so far in Britain, Scelidosaurus, to name but a few.",,Science Daily,Gharial,,,0.0,0.3,"Wildlife, Other",Other,"Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), Other",English

The Jammu and Kashmir earlier had a Deer Park at Manda near here which is being converted into a rescue centre by the Central Zoo Authority.
Named after Raja Jambu Lochan, who, according to folklore, had founded the Jammu city after seeing a lion and goat drinking water together on the bank of Tawi, the Jambu Zoo with a total area of 162 hectares will be the biggest zoo in North India. Initially it will have 27 species of rare animals and birds brought from different states of the country, they said.
Its main attractions will be a pair each of Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion, the black buck, ghariyal and the marsh crocodile, officials said, adding that except for Chandigarh, these animals are not available in any other zoo across North India.
While the Asiatic Lion will come from Gujarat, the Hisar and Chennai zoos have consented to send marsh crocodile and the Bengal tiger, respectively. However, permission from Central Zoo Authority (CZA) is awaited, said the J&amp;Ks Chief Wildlife Warden, Suresh Kumar Gupta.
The Jambu Zoo will also get a gharial from Lucknow zoo after the onset of monsoon and permission in this regard has been received from CZA, he said, adding that they have also approached the zoo officials in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh to send sloth beer.
At present, it has leopard, black beer, samber, goral, hog deer, neelgai, cheetal, porcupine, peacock, flightless bird, leopard cat and jungle cat. Among the reptiles, it has spectacled snake, rat snake, water snake, russells viper, python and royal snake. All these have been shifted from Manda Deer Park, officials said.
To enhance the visitors experience, it has battery operated vehicles and cycles for zoo visit, three parks, including one having a facility of childcare room, water points, and trail paths.
It is a complete nature park with a variety of amenities for visitors, including awareness and education centre, according to Wildlife Department officials. Even zoo animal enclosures have been laid in natural settings, they said, adding that it has the potential for shooting movies and commercials.
Apart from this, it also has an amphitheatre, nature interpretation centre, orientation centre for awareness of visitors, and refreshment points. The zoo has both online and offline ticketing facilities, apart from a parking facility for 130 cars, nine buses and 90 two-wheelers.However, there will be no ticket for visitors during the first month as announced by the Lt Governor, officials said.
Speaking on the occasion, Lt Governor Manoj Sinha said that the Union Territory is at a cusp in its development trajectory.
We are now at a stage where we need to accelerate this growth, make it more inclusive and convert the UT’s potential into reality, Sinha said. The scenic beauty around the first-of-its-kind full-fledged zoo in the UT will make it a unique tourist destination and has the potential to boost tourism in the region, he added.",,The Indian Express,Gharial,,,0.8,0.7,"Wildlife, Governance, Other",Other,"Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris ssp. tigris), Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), Other",English

Freshwater mugger crocodiles and gharials are turning orange in Nepal, and scientists think it's down to iron in the waters where they hang out.
The orange crocs were spotted in Chitwan National Park, a protected area of the Himalayan foothills. ""Have these crocs been drinking too much Sunny D? Messily eating Cheetos? Or could they be taking fashion advice from Donald Trump?"" Phoebe Griffith
, a postdoctoral researcher at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, wrote in a Twitter thread
 on May 29. 
To find out why the crocs have become tangerine-colored, researchers collaborated with Project Mecistops — a conservation project working to preserve and reintroduce critically endangered West African slender-snouted crocodiles (Mecistops cataphractus) in Côte d'Ivoire and throughout western Africa. 
It turns out some of the rivers and streams in the park have extremely high levels of iron, which could explain why some crocodilians are sporting orange coats.
""Gharial and mugger crocodiles who spent lots of time in some streams, or near the mouths of them, were getting a serious fake tan,"" Griffith explained on Twitter. ""Turns out some areas of Chitwan have seriously high levels of iron in the water, and iron reacts with oxygen to form an orange substance called iron oxide.""

As these crocs spend most of their time in the water — gharials are not well-suited to walking on land and typically only crawl onto sandbanks to bask in the sun or nest — the iron-rich rivers could have coated their scales and teeth in a temporary layer of rusty particles.
Gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) are critically endangered
 freshwater crocodiles that have a long, narrow snout tipped with a bulbous growth. Males can grow to be around16 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 550 pounds (250 kilograms). 
The gharial population in Nepal has plummeted by 98% since the 1940s due to overhunting, according to the Zoological Society of London
. Most of the 200 remaining gharials live in Chitwan National Park, where they face additional threats linked to pollution, mining and declining fish populations.
Mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) are more widespread and inhabit marshes and waterways stretching from southern Iran to the Indian subcontinent. They are broad-snouted and similar in size to gharials, but they can weigh twice as much due to their girth. 
… and yep! Turns out some area of Chitwan have seriously high levels of iron in the water, and iron reacts with oxygen to form an orange substance called iron oxide.

The discolored gharials’ and crocodiles’ new orange look is temporary, and the rusty particles could wash off in less iron-rich waters. ""It should go off automatically in clean(er) water,"" Lala Aswini Kumar Singh, a zoologist and wildlife researcher in India, wrote in a comment on Twitter.
These aren't the first rust-colored reptiles on record. A 2016 study in the African Journal of Ecology
 reported that orange dwarf crocodiles (Osteolaemus tetraspis) living in caves in Gabon may have turned orange after being exposed to bat guano, which contains high levels of urea — a substance with a bleaching effect that forms when protein is broken down in the liver.

Felicity Carter, another Castlegate resident, found Pete after he was shot. Carter picked him up as quickly as she could and rushed him over to an exotic veterinarian, according to FOX KWU-TV.
I found him up against the fence, and he had an arrow sticking out of him. He just kind of laid there, almost like he knew I was trying to help him, Carter shared.
Pete arrived to Lone Mountain Animal Hospital with severe injuries.
The vet called and said that he had actually been shot twice. Once in the neck, that went completely through and through, barely missing his jugular and his esophagus, and then the body cavity shot that was actually stuck in him still, said Carter.
Despite receiving medical treatment, the peacock died as a result of his injuries.
This was just such a senseless crime, and I dont understand how anybody can just be so morbid and just shoot a defenseless animal. I will not stop until I find out who did this to him. We have to do something for Pete, Carter told KWU-TV.
After the attack, Castlegates HOA asked residents to check their surveillance footage and report any information to the authorities. The citys animal protection services continue to investigate, KWU-TV reported.

As of Wednesday, the aggro otterherself a member of an endangered species found in central Californiastill remains at large, stalking the waters off the coast of Santa Cruz for her next barney victim.
The 5-year-old female otter has been designated otter 841 by California wildlife officials. Her usual MO is to jump onto surfers boards before biting down on the board. Depending on the material, the otter can end up taking chunks out of the board, and, depending on the day, 841 can be more or less aggressive as she tries to nab a board from unsuspecting Santa Cruz surfers. Locals have noticed her activity has become far more pugnacious since this past weekend.
In a video shared Tuesday by local photographer Mark Woodward, who goes by Native Santa Cruz online, 841 latched onto a surfers board before scaring the owner off. She then munched down for several seconds even as the surfer tried to shoo her away. In another instance, a surfer abandoned the board to a romp of multiple otters, but the largest one decided to hang 10 for a bit before a local sailing catamaran managed to save the board. 841 has reportedly tried to steal a surfboard on three occasions this past weekend.
Other video captured by Santa Cruz locals shows 841 stalking surfers like a tiny, furry rendition of Jaws. The otter has forced surfers off their boards and patently refused to jump off, no matter how many times they flip the board or splash her.
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is now getting involved. The agency told The New York Times it was working with the Monterey Bay Aquarium to safely capture and rehome Otter 841. So far, despite attempts to recapture her, 841 remains at large. According to the Times report, the otter will be transferred back to the aquarium before being transferred to another location where she can live out the rest of her days.
This sea otter was observed with a pup after returning to the Santa Cruz area in May 2022. She exhibited similar unusual behavior in the Santa Cruz area in September 2022, at which time CDFW and Monterey Bay Aquarium staff successfully hazed the otter preventing further incident throughout the winter, the Fish and Wildlife Department said in a statement. 
According to a tweet from Woodward, local officials have posted signs near the popular surf spot warning people away from the aggressive sea otter in this area.
The creatures were just one of many mammal species caught up in the 18th and 19th century fur trades that decimated other species of beaver and otter along North American waterways and bays. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, there are as few as 3,000 California sea otters left alive in recent years, even though their population has been slowly growing since the 1970s. The federal agency advises that folks try and keep a safe distance from the creatures and to not feed them, as this could make them aggressive.
Thats what reportedly happened to 841s mother. The Times mentioned that 841s mom was raised in captivity after being orphaned at a young age. After she was released into the wild, locals fed her squid which caused her to become too close to humans, incentivizing her to hop aboard kayaks in search of more food. She was recaptured, and gave birth to 841.
Even though Monterey Bay Aquarium researchers said they tried measures to prevent 841 from becoming accustomed to humans while in captivity, she started interacting with folks hanging out in the surf within a year of being released. Her board hopping spree wasnt a major problem back in 2021, but as of late shes become far more bold, a situation which is both dangerous to 841 and to humans.
Theres been quite a fair bit of dustups between sea life and humanity as of late. In recent months, Orca attacks against small sea-faring ships are on the rise. Even with new acoustic devices meant to dissuade these killer whales from bumping vessels, the sea does seem to be in revolt after decade after decade of ocean devastation and increased ship traffic harming maritime life.",,Gizmodo.com,Otter,,,0.1,0.8,"Wildlife, Other",Other,"Otter (Lutra lutra & Lutrogale perspicillata), Other",English

Florida health officials reported this week that a 74-year-old man and a dog were bitten by an aggressive otter, one that later tested positive for the usually fatal viral infection. Both victims have reportedly received treatment and the otter has been euthanized.
The Florida Department of Health reported the attack Monday, which occurred last Wednesday in Palm Beach County. The man, since identified as Joseph Scaglione by WPBF News, was reportedly feeding corn to some ducks near his home when they suddenly flew away. He then saw the otter by a river bank and began to slowly back up. But before he could make it back home, the otter rushed after him and caused him to fall. The animal then went on the attack for several minutes, biting and scratching Scagliones legs and arms over 40 times.
Scaglione did eventually manage to break free. But according to Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control, the otter came across a family of three and attacked their dog at some point on the same day. Neighborhood residents reportedly then trapped the otter under a recycling bin and he was finally captured by Animal Control. According to officials, the otter was at a healthy weight but appeared to be unusually active at first and then lethargic. Rabies testing can only be done post-mortem, meaning that the otter had to be euthanized, and officials confirmed the otters infection on Saturday.
Rabies is one of the scariest viral diseases around. The virus invades the nervous system of its mammal hosts. In most mammals, including humans, the infection eventually causes brain swelling and frightening neurological symptoms like confusion and aggression, the loss of bodily functions, and a pathological fear of water. Once these symptoms start, survival is almost impossible.
Thankfully, theres a rabies vaccine available for both humans and domestic animals, which has helped significantly drive down human cases in many countries. While the vaccine is routinely given to pets and livestock, its more often used in humans as a prophylactic (along with specialized antibodies) to those suspected of being exposed to the virus. So long as this treatment is given early enough following exposure, its highly effective at preventing illness. Rabies is still a problem in countries where vaccination isnt widespread, however, and the virus continues to circulate in wildlife everywhere. Human rabies cases in the U.S. are very rare, though there was a recent uptick reported in 2021.
There have been other documented attacks by potentially rabid otters on humans, though these aquatic animals are considered an uncommon host for the virus. According to Animal Control officials, this is the first case of otter rabies reported in the state since 2010.

Here, we marvel at some of the extremes of the cat world smallest, fluffiest and more and see what evolution has done with these magnificent mammals. 
1. Cheetah: The Speed Demon
(Credit: Elana Erasmus/Shutterstock)
Holding the records for the world's fastest cat and fastest land animal, cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) can reach speeds of over 60 miles per hour. 
Every part of this fast feline is built for speed. Their non-retractable claws act like cleats, providing traction during high-speed chases. Their tails, measuring roughly 2.5 feet, serve as rudders, allowing them to turn on a dime. Even their breathing is adapted for speed; thanks to their relatively small teeth, cheetahs have room for larger nasal passages that allow for quick air intake.
Cheetahs endangered status has made them the focus of captive breeding programs at zoos. Occasionally, these captive cheetahs are paired with canine companions to reduce their shyness and make them more willing to mate.

2. Rusty-Spotted Cat: The Diminutive Hunter

Miniature but mighty, the rusty-spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus) takes the title of worlds smallest cat. When fully grown, this compact carnivore tips the scales at a mere 5 pounds.
A master of hide-and-seek, the rusty-spotted cat is found in the forests of India, Sri Lanka and, as of its 2016 discovery, Nepal. Using their agility and tree climbing prowess, rusty-spotted cats hunt small animals including rodents, birds, lizards, frogs and insects.
Though these petite predators could potentially adapt to living alongside human populations, threats from domestic dogs and vehicles remain a constant danger to their survival. 
3. Sand Cat: The Dexterous Desert Dweller

The sand cat (Felis margarita), native to the Sahara Desert, Arabian Peninsula and parts of central Asia, is equipped to endure extreme conditions.
These desert dwellers boast thick fur and heavily padded paws, insulating them against temperatures that can fluctuate from a scorching 120 degrees to below freezing. During the blistering daytime, these cats take refuge in burrows, only emerging to hunt under the cover of night.
Adding to their list of desert adaptations is their ability to go weeks without drinking water. Instead, sand cats get all the hydration they need from their food. These bold predators are skilled enough to hunt venomous snakes, alongside easier prey like rodents, lizards and insects.

4. Pallas Cat: The Ultimate Fluff Ball

When it comes to fluff, no cat beats the Pallas cat (Otocolobus manul). Sporting the longest, densest fur among all cats, this feline wonder is decked out with fur nearly twice as long on their belly and tail than on their top and sides. This luxuriously thick coat isn't just for show it keeps them toasty on hunts on snowy or frozen terrain, changing seasonally to become even longer and heavier during winter.
These cats prefer the high life, making their homes in the steppe grassland regions of Mongolia, China and the Tibetan Plateau, where they thrive at elevations up to a dizzying 15,000 feet.
5. Fishing Cat: The Aquatic Adventurer
(Credit: slowmotiongli/Shutterstock)
Defying the stereotype that ""cats despise water"" that hangs over house cats, the fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) doesn't hesitate to plunge right in. This water-loving cat makes its home in marshes, swamps and flooded agricultural areas in south and southeast Asia. 
Equipped with partially-webbed toes, the fishing cat is an exceptional swimmer. Their fur is specially adapted to act as a kind of dry suit that prevents water from reaching the skin. They also have claws that dont fully retract, which helps them snag slippery fish to eat. 
Besides fish, their diet includes small mammals, birds and shellfish.

6. Snow Leopard: The Long-Tailed Trekker
(Credit: Abeselom Zerit/Shutterstock)
Inhabiting the stark, frigid peaks of Central Asia, the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) reigns as the cat with the longest tail relative to body size. 
When measured from nose to tail tip, the snow leopards tail can make up half of their body length. This multipurpose appendage aids snow leopards in maintaining balance on rugged terrain, providing insulation against the severe cold, and storing additional fat for times when prey is scarce.
Powered by formidable hind legs, these elusive cats can leap six times their body length. 
But the snow leopards vulnerable conservation status make it difficult for scientists to learn more about them in the wild.
7. Siberian Tiger: The King of Cats
(Credit: GUDKOV ANDREY/Shutterstock)
With mature males weighing up to 600 pounds, the Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is the largest living member of the wild cat family. These formidable cats, also known as Amur tigers, roam the forests of eastern Russia, as well as parts of China, North Korea and Mongolia. 
To fuel their massive, powerful bodies, Siberian tigers hunt deer, wild pigs and whatever other meat they can get their paws on, consuming up to 100 pounds in one sitting. 
In addition to their utility in hunting, their large paws function like natural snowshoes, enabling them to effortlessly navigate through deep snow.
Despite their strength, these majestic creatures face a significant challenge: a lack of genetic diversity due to threats from increasing human populations, habitat loss, illegal hunting and expanded trade in tiger parts for traditional medicines.

On Friday night, more than 8,000 gallons of hazardous chemicals spilled into Otter Creek (also known as Mill Creek), which flows into the Delaware River, the largest source of drinking water for the city.
Based on testing, Philadelphias tap water remains safe to drink at least until late Monday night, according to local officials. 
The Philadelphia Water Department is confident that tap water from the Baxter Drinking Water Treatment Plant will remain safe to drink and use at least through 11:59 p.m. today (Monday, March 27, 2023.) This assurance is due to the treatment and continuous testing of water that is currently available to residents, the city noted in its latest update at 1:30 p.m. ET on Monday, echoing an earlier text alert transmitted to cell phones in the Philly area.
However, that safety assessment could change after 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday, per the citys water department. For now, officials are recommending that residents in the affected area fill up water containers at home for an emergency supply, pending more test results.
Previously, Philadelphia advised residents to switch to bottled water in an earlier emergency alert. Officials later updated that advisory following testing and said the tap water is safe to drink for the time being.
Yet, though later walked-back, the alert stoked panic and caused a run on bottled water locally. Many Philadelphia-area grocery stores ran out, according to reports from The Philadelphia Inquirer and other outlets. In one anecdote, a Philadelphia-based friend texted me to say that an ACME grocery in North Philly was advising people to buy Gatorade as an alternative over the stores PA system. 
What Happened to Philadelphias Water?
The small chemical spill was reported at around 11:40 p.m. on Friday, according to a Coast Guard press release. The company responsible, Trinseo Altuglas LLC, said that the spill was the result of an equipment failure at its Bristol facility in a Sunday news statement. It claimed that 8,100 gallons of a latex solution overflowed the on-site containment and entered a storm drain, where it flowed to Otter Creek and then to the Delaware River, in the release.
Altuglas makes acrylic resin and other plastic materials. The company and city officials have described the mixture spilled into Otter Creek as a latex product or latex emulsion. Butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate are all chemicals thought to be in the spilled solution, according to the cityand its these three compounds that officials are testing and monitoring for. 
Baxter Drinking Water Treatment Plant, Phillys largest tap water provider, takes in water from the Delaware River downstream of the spill. The concern is that the pollution could therefore end up in a portion of the citys drinking water. However, so far, officials have said none of the chemicals of concern have actually been detected at Baxter or elsewhere in the citys water system. The treatment plant has only taken in water once since the spill occurred, and officials reported no detectable contamination in that intake. 
Baxter will need to re-up its water reserves before Tuesday, and more testing will need to be done to verify the continued safety of the tap water then, officials have explained. Philadelphia city government held a press briefing on Sunday about the spill. Another briefing is scheduled for 5 p.m. ET Monday. 
The chemicals (butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate) are all known to be respiratory and skin irritants, above certain levels. However, less is known what impacts these chemicals have on human health when ingested, particularly with short-term exposure, Keeve Nachman, a toxicologist and environmental health researcher at Johns Hopkins University, told Gizmodo by phone. 
The Environmental Protection Agency has established a reference dosage for one of the three compounds, methyl methacrylate, which is considered the safe threshold for regular exposure. Based on that EPA reference dosage (1.4 milligrams per kg of bodyweight per day), a person would need to ingest a lot of methyl methacrylate to experience adverse health effects.
Ingestion symptoms for all three chemicals may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, according to the National Institutes of Heaths PubChem. Yet Nachman pointed out that the city of Philadelphia hasnt released enough information to assess whether or not those are symptoms people could potentially face in the current scenario. To accurately assess risk, Nachman said he would need to know what level of each chemical is circulating in the river water, if any. 
We need to know more about how much of this chemical people [could] actually be getting through their drinking water, and for how long, before we comment on risk, the toxicologist explained. 
Yet even with the unknowns, he seemed optimistic that this spill likely wont cause serious harm. Usually, health impacts of water pollution are assessed over the long term, Nachman explained. If any contamination does manage to enter the water supply, it is likely to be a less dangerous, short-term exposure, he said. It may be the case that people are not exposed long enough for us to be concerned about drinking water. 
Ultimately, if the contamination doesnt stay in the river long, it seems unlikely that people would get sick, Nachman said. 
Additionally, given the size of the spill, chemical concentrations in the water are likely to be very low. The 8,000+ gallons spilled is tiny, relative to the amount of water in the Delaware River as it passes through Philadelphia. For context, more than 1 million gallons flow through the waterway per second at Trenton, NJ and Penns Landing, according to USGS monitoring data.

But its outlaw status has turned the slippery sea otter into an international icon, with growing support to leave her in the wild.
The 5-year-old female otter, known officially as otter 841, has been deemed a public safety risk by state and federal wildlife officials because of her ""unusually aggressive"" behavior along the Santa Cruz coast. As a result, wildlife officials and Monterey Bay Aquarium staff are attempting to capture and rehome the otter to an aquarium or zoo, according to a joint news release. But support for a live-and-let-live approach is growing with each unsuccessful attempt.
Mark Woodward is a local Santa Cruz photographer who has chronicled 841's adventures for over a month on Instagram. Last week, he snapped a photo of an activist dressed as an otter holding a surfboard that read ""Keep 841 free."" Another local, Ann Stadler, voiced her support for otter 841 in a letter to the editorin the Santa Cruz Sentinel published on Thursday.
""I don't have all the facts and history of the incidents but it just seems to me to be yet another example of humans feeling that they have the right of way on the earth and that other contemporary species and their rights to their native habitats are expendable,"" Stadler wrote. 
There are several petitions circulating online in support of 841's freedom, one of which has gathered over 50,000 signatures. 
Otter 841's antics have garnered international attention and generated memes in support of the otter's freedom. This meme from @thesurfingottter on Instagram is a parody of Batman from Christopher Nolan's 2008 film The Dark Knight.
@thesurfingotter/Instagram
The otter's antics have become a viral sensation in recent weeks, generating a multitude of memes shared across social media platforms. Santa Cruz's most wanted even has an Instagram fan page, @thesurfingotter, home to a series of parody images, including one that compares otter 841 to Batman in Christopher Nolan's 2008 film The Dark Knight.
""She's the hero Santa Cruz deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt her. Because she can take it,"" the meme reads. ""Because she's not our hero. She's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark night.""
Inclement weather has proven advantageous for Otter 841, which has evaded capture for over a week. Scientists want to bring her to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for an evaluation before rehoming her to a zoo or aquarium.
Laird Henkel/California Department of Fish and Wildlife
However, the agencies charged with catching 841 have maintained their stance that capturing and rehoming her is best for the otter and humans alike. Biologists say catching the otter could take days or weeks because of environmental conditions like water clarity. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) told NPR that capture efforts could be ""suspended or halted entirely"" if the otter continues to elude officials and stops interacting with people.
Wildlife experts remain uncertain about why the otter is behaving this way. Monterey Bay Aquarium spokesperson Kevin Connor previously told NPR that otter 841 was born in the aquarium approximately five years ago, where she was raised by her mother and minimally cared for by staff disguised in black rubber suits and welding masks to hide their human appearance. 
She was successfully released into the wild in June 2020 and appeared to be doing well, until last September, when her interactions with humans were first documented in the area. 
The CDFW says the otter could be behaving this way because of positive interactions with people, such as feeding, which would explain why she's not exhibiting a healthy fear of humans. Officials want to catch the otter so she can be thoroughly examined at the Monterey Bay Aquarium before finding her a new home, all but certainly in an approved zoo or aquarium.
Like her current summer escapades, otter 841 was caught harassing surfers in Santa Cruz last September. CDFW and aquarium staff were able to drive her away from the area, but she returned to her stomping grounds and resumed her unusual behavior last month.",,NPR,Otter,,,0.2,0.7,"Wildlife, Governance, Other",Other,"Otter (Lutra lutra & Lutrogale perspicillata), Other",English

It is the first time the nation has publicly destroyed seized wildlife products for this reason.
The pangolin is one of the world's most trafficked mammals - their scales are in high demand in traditional Chinese medicine.
Nigeria is a major transit hub for African pangolin scales and other wildlife products trafficked to Asia.
""These seized items represent the past we leave behind, but the destruction signifies the future we are determined to build for our planet,"" Environment Minister Iziaq Adekunle said before the burning took place in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. 
""The destruction of these seized items is a powerful statement of our resolve to protect our environment, conserve our wildlife, and combat the illegal trade that drives species to the brink of extinction."" 
Image source, NESREA/Facebook
Image caption, The scales were incinerated publicly in Abuja, Nigeria's capital
The almost four tonnes of pangolin scales were destroyed alongside seized leopard, python and crocodile skins.
The agency had confiscated the scales in collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) and a pan-African alliance named the Elephant Protection Initiative.
In August, the leaders of a global wildlife trafficking gang were convicted for smuggling pangolin scales after a four-year investigation and a trial in Nigeria.
These ""top-of-the-pyramid"" traffickers were responsible for half the illegal trade in pangolin scales.
And last year, Nigerian customs officials seized 1,613 tonnes of pangolin scales and arrested 14 people, Nigeria's Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency said.
Populations of the critically endangered pangolin populations have declined by up to 80% in some parts of Africa in recent years.
According to UNDOC, seizures of pangolin scales increased tenfold between 2014 and 2018.

They pleaded guilty last month to smuggling the scales of endangered African pangolins.
These ""top-of-the-pyramid"" traffickers were responsible for half the illegal trade in pangolin scales.
This is the story of how they were outwitted by fake buyers and sting operations - conducted by a small European charity. 
A young Vietnamese woman is on a dangerous undercover mission. 
She is sitting at a table in a café somewhere in Vietnam. Across from her is one of the country's main wildlife traffickers. 
Image caption, Van - not her real name - works undercover against wildlife traffickers
Van - not her real name - is posing as a buyer for a Chinese crime boss in a trade illegal in many parts of the world, the trafficking of pangolins which are eaten in Africa, while their scales are used in traditional medicine in Asia. 
Outside, a surveillance team watches in case her cover is blown. 
""I was nervous for about 20 seconds but then, after that, I thought 'I can do this',"" she says.
Van's contact is trying to sell her scales from what the World Wildlife Fund says is the world's most trafficked mammal, the pangolin.
Researchers estimate that in the decade from 2010, almost a million pangolins were killed to supply trafficking networks. 
All eight species - four African and four Asian - are listed as threatened, with three considered critically endangered. 
Image source, Nigeria Customs Service
Image caption, The Nigeria Customs Service seized 7,000 kilos of pangolin scales in a raid in 2021
Van works for the Wildlife Justice Commission, a charity set up in 2015 to disrupt criminal networks making money from wildlife trafficking.
Its lead investigator is Steve Carmody, a hard-nosed former Australian police officer who used to tackle drug gangs.
""My passion is to catch crooks,"" he says, at the charity's secret base in the Netherlands.
In 2018, Carmody noticed huge seizures of trafficked animal parts hidden in shipping containers en route from West Africa to Asia. 
He started gathering intelligence on the Asian buyers, in an investigation called Operation Hydra.
When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, it offered him a rare and unexpected opportunity.
Big-time wildlife traffickers usually stay hidden, he explains: ""You may see their wives flaunting their wealth, but the main traffickers we investigate are not on social media.""
But Covid meant there were fewer shipments and, in desperation, traffickers turned to Facebook to find buyers.
Image caption, On Carmody's desk lie nearly a dozen untraceable phones he uses to contact the targets of his investigations, pretending to be a buyer
""We started using multiple undercovers to talk with these guys,"" Carmody says. One was Van, whom he describes as ""the perfect person to take that investigation forward"". 
She is softly spoken with a steely determination. Being a woman in this business is unusual, but Van says it was an advantage as traffickers were more likely to drop their guard: ""They are not as suspicious as when a man approaches them.""
Over months she gained the trust of Morybinet Berete, who is from Guinea in West Africa but was based in Nigeria, the hub for the illicit trade in pangolin scales. 
Berete was ""living the dream"", says Carmody, ""driving a nice car, there was a nice house"". The team gave him the codename Genie for their surveillance logs, because someone liked the Disney film Aladdin. 
Despite the difficulties of mounting operations during the pandemic, Carmody says the job was made easier because operators like Berete tend to be business people who have drifted into crime: ""They don't have the skillsets you would see with a normal street-level drug supplier.""
Media caption, Morybinet Berete, aka Genie, on a video call with undercover investigators
Van went undercover online, gaining the trust of Berete on WhatsApp. In one video call he can be seen walking into the yard of a compound. He points the phone's camera at a large pile of a dozen or so sacks. One of them is opened at the top. It's full of pangolin scales he wants to sell to Van. 
There are more sacks across the yard, each stuffed with thousands of scales stripped from the carcasses of pangolins.
While undercover, Van had to conceal her true feelings, but two years later she remains shocked.
""A hundred thousand pangolins need to get killed for that,"" she says, ""I was so sad inside because I love animals. Wildlife is my passion.""
What was Morybinet Berete's view of the beautiful, secretive creatures whose scales he and his gang were trafficking?
""He's just doing business. The animals mean nothing to them,"" says Van.
But the WhatsApp video proved to be Berete's big mistake. Investigators used details from it to locate his address. 
""It's like Pablo Escobar telling you where he lives in Colombia, and showing the cocaine in his basement,"" says Carmody.
Corruption is a major driver of wildlife crime. Carmody describes the hardest part of any global investigation as finding a ""small group of dedicated law enforcement officers that can't be bought. And once you find them, it's like finding gold"". 
In Nigeria, that means the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS).
Image source, Nigeria Customs Service
Image caption, Pangolin Scales seized by the Nigeria Customs Service in 2021
In July 2021, he tipped off NCS officials, who raided Berete's compound in Nigeria and seized 7,000 kilos of pangolin scales, with smaller amounts of claws and elephant tusks. They arrested three men, although Morybinet Berete was not at home. 
But searching the suspects' phones led to another big breakthrough - the identities of the Asian buyers. 
That shifted the focus of the investigation from Nigeria back to Vietnam, where a surveillance operation was mounted in March last year to follow the buyers. 
The traffickers were given their own codenames. Second-in-command was Benz, thanks to the Mercedes he drove.
Ringleader Phan Chi was Big Mac because someone in the surveillance team was hungry when they named him.

Carmody laughs and says: ""More embarrassingly, another co-accused is Fries."" 
Pretending to be working for a Chinese buyer, Van built their trust, helping to figure out how the trafficking ring worked.
Big Mac bought trafficked scales from Berete who was now on the run in West Africa. The scales were smuggled out of Nigeria -mainly on boats - and sold on to clients in China. There, they were passed off as Asian pangolin scales, which can be legally used in traditional medicine. Shipments were often paid in cryptocurrency tied to the US dollar.
Another undercover investigator coaxed the gang into incriminating themselves. In a WhatsApp video call he asks what they want to buy. ""In Nigeria only pangolin,"" Big Mac responds.

Benz said he needed 20 tonnes of scales shipped to Vietnam, complaining that police had seized stock the previous summer. With the evidence mounting, the investigators were closing in. 
Last May, the Vietnamese traffickers returned to Africa to buy more wildlife products. From Mozambique, Benz sent video of rhino horn he had earlier hidden in suitcases to smuggle aboard a flight.

Days later the gang arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, with Big Mac boasting in a video that he can ""send a container from here"".
What he didn't realise is that surveillance teams had been following him since his arrival in the country. The Nigeria Customs Service pounced. 
Big Mac was seized in his hotel room with two phones, providing a treasure trove of evidence. 
""This is a guy who did ledgers for each shipment: profit, loss, who he paid, what purpose, where it went,"" says Carmody.
""It's like you're reading an accountant's version of a criminal transaction. This evidence is overwhelming, linking these guys to multiple shipments of rhino horn, ivory and pangolin. Big Mac is a big deal. He's huge.""
Phan Chi (Big Mac), Phan Quan (Benz) and Duong Thang (Fries) were charged with smuggling and trading in pangolin scales and elephant ivory.
Faced with little chance of acquittal, they admitted their guilt on the eve of a trial earlier this month. Morybinet Berete's brother Mory also pleaded guilty. Other trials will follow. 
The four men were sentenced to six years each, avoiding more time behind bars by agreeing to pay fines as part of a plea bargain. 
For Steve Carmody, the convictions are ground-breaking. He says until now the focus in Africa has been on big sentences for wildlife poachers. Targeting the key players has been rare: ""I can't underestimate the value of this trial. These guys are the top of the pyramid.""
What about Morybinet Berete, aka Genie, on the run since July 2021 and facing a court order for his arrest?
""I like fishing,"" says Carmody. He points to the phones on his desk: ""I often throw out a few lines from different phones just to see who bites. Genie keeps biting.""
Soon Carmody, Van and the team hope to reel him in.

Then add scales.
Thats how Mercia Angela describes the pangolins she cares for at the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique, where she runs the countrys only rescue center for the worlds most illegally trafficked mammal. They sleep a lot, she says.
Pangolins are nocturnal by nature and elusive in the wild, preferring to burrow in savannas and floodplains, or scrabble up trees in wooded areas where they can remain out of sight. Yet, despite their demure ways, they are the focus of a harrowing drama, their species poached to near extinction by a massive and illegal worldwide trade.
Thats where Angelas rehab centerand the lush sprawl of Gorongosa as a wholecome in. Its been a little more than three decades since the ravages of Mozambiques 15-year civil war, by which time Gorongosas population of large mammals had shrunk by 95 percent. Antelope had been slaughtered to feed troops and hundreds of elephants had been killed, their tusks traded for guns. Pangolins didnt fare any better. For centuries, their meat has been prized as a delicacy in Southeast Asia, and their scales valued in traditional medicinal practices in China. In the West, pangolins barely had a public profile until they were briefly but incorrectly implicated as a possible origin of the COVID-19 virus. Now, because populations in Southeast Asia have been decimated, the pangolins native to sub-Saharan Africa are being caught in poachers snares.
The stunned animals roll up and become as compact as a medicine ball, making them easy to scoop up and shove in a sack.
After 30 years of restoration, Gorongosa has become a leading African conservation project, the pangolin rescue one of its central missions. Encompassing 1,500 square miles at the southern end of the Rift Valley, the park may host as many as 75,000 different species of flora and fauna. Among them, the African Ground Pangolin plies its lonely nighttime trade, its excavations making it a sort of gardener providing invaluable rejuvenation of the soil.
Currently, Angela, a wildlife veterinarian, is caring for two pangolinsa baby of only a few months that was rescued from traffickers by Gorongosas rangers, and an adult, brought to the center by locals living near the park who were concerned that it, too, might end up ensnared in the trade. The babya male that Angela calls Temboarrived in September hungry and traumatized. Angela kept him on a diet of milk for three months to help him gain weight before he graduated to ants, which he siphons up at a rate of nearly half a pound a day. She forecasts that in the next few months he might be ready to join the other 98 pangolins Gorongosa has rescued since her center started work in 2018.
The addition of Tembo to that number will be significant. So pervasive is the poaching that the worlds population of pangolins is thought to have dropped by as much as 80 percent over the past two decades alone, the Swiss-based International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has warned.
As rare a find as pangolins are, theyre unmissable. Adult pangolins can be as big as racoons and weigh as much as 40 pounds, but they bear a striking resemblance to an artichoke with legs. Their heads and bodies are riveted with an armor of thorny scales, making them look reptilian. Despite their otherworldly appearance, their scales have a characteristic familiar to every humantheyre made of keratin, the same protein that makes up our fingernails and hair.
In zoological literature, pangolins are loosely referred to as scaley anteaters because of that armor and their diet, but they arent related to true anteaters. Rather, they belong to a group all their ownone of the strangest orders of mammalsthe Pholidata, which contains only eight living species.
Four of these are found across much of Asia, in countries ranging from India to China, and farther to Malaysia and the Philippines. The other fourincluding the African Ground Pangolinare native to sub-Saharan countries stretching from Sudan to South Africa. All of them are at risk of extinction, the IUCN says. The grandest international effort taken against the illegal trade in pangolins came in 2016, when 183 nations signed the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species, known as Cites, which placed all eight species of pangolin in the documents Appendix I, giving them the strictest protections.

Similar to carnivores by descent and armadillos by convergent evolution, pangolins are most closely related to bears andyescats. But they are almost monastic when compared to those more outgoing cousins. The male and female pangolin come together only to mate, with females capable of giving birth to one baby about every two years. Angela says the single offspring then spend about four months riding on their mothers tail as they get the hang of hunting. Then they separate and set off for a solitary life all their own, sometimes living as long as 20 years.
And its the lonely foraging and burrowing of the African Ground Pangolin that Angela says makes them so essential to the recovery of Gorongosas ecosystem. Making quick work of ant and termite hills, pangolins burrow after their prey with deft foreclaws and long, slithering tongues. And where they sniff and nudge the soil by night, nutrients can penetrate more deeply by day, helping to replenish food stores for Gorongosas other animals and encouraging rejuvenation of the vegetation.
This appetite has other benefits. Angela says that most adult pangolins can eat about a pound of their quarry in their daily feeding, guarding against destructive termite and ant plagues.
But for all the waste they lay to their prey, pangolins are almost entirely harmless to any other living creature. When this bashful animal is frightened, it curls up into a tight ball, the scales offering its firstand, really, onlyline of defense.
Sadly, its that defense mechanism that Mercia says makes them so susceptible to capture by traffickers. As poachers drive pangolins into the open by setting fire to their burrows or by battering them out of trees with sticks and clubs, the stunned animals roll up and become as compact as a medicine ball, making them easy to scoop up and shove in a sack.
Often, when poachers are interested only in the scales, they drop the curled-up pangolins into pots of water and boil them alive to make the scales easier to pluck. From there, the scales make their way to Nigeria, where smugglers bundle them with other wildlife contraband like elephant tusks and ship them off to Asia.
Owing to pangolins reclusive night-time routines, naturalists have famously been unable to settle on an exact worldwide census for the animals. But the scant handful of national figures that researchers have managed to assemble suggests that there may be fewer than 150,000 left on the African continent, though the question is still open to debate and ripe for more study. Similarly, putting exact numbers to the illegal pangolin trade is challenging, but the most authoritative study, published in 2020 by German biologist Sarah Heinrich and Oxford zoologist Daniel Challender, among others, documented that at least 895,000 had been trafficked from African and Asian countries in the two decades before their study was written, though they conceded the actual number is likely much higher.
Nearly a million pangolins have been trafficked from African and Asian countries in the past two decades.
Heinrich and others shed light on the history and dynamics of the pangolin trade in another paper published that same year. For centuries, various parts of the pangolin anatomy have featured prominently in traditional Chinese medicineparticularly the scales. If those were ground to powder or burned to ash, the old texts held, they could ward off evil spirits and midnight hysterias, provide a salve against ant bites, hemorrhoids and malaria, stimulate lactation in women, and aid in circulation. Western science doesnt support these claims, but the traditions proved persistent, with more than 200 Chinese pharmaceutical firms offering medicines based on pangolin scales. Indeed, it wasnt until 2020 that Chinese health insurers stopped covering these remedies.
Pangolins are also a prized delicacy in Vietnam. Challender describes visiting an upscale Ho Chi Minh City restaurant in 2012, where he watched a group of diners pay $700 for a meal consisting of about 4 pounds of pangolin meat. The animal was brought to their table alive, its throat slit in front of them, and its blood was mixed with wine before its flesh was grilled.
But the 2016 study by Henrich highlighted another historic pangolin consumerthe United States. Between 1975 and 2000when Cites set the export quota for Asian Pangolins to zero, essentially banning the international tradeAmerica was a voracious client of the pangolins striking diamond-patterned skin, using it for wallets, handbags, and high-end cowboy boots. Many of these items can still be found on the grayish markets of the internet, though for a stiff price. University of Adelaide professors Joshua Ross and Phill Cassey, in a 2019 paper co-authored with Heinrich, described tracking down a pair of pangolin skin boots for sale on the U.S. eBay site for $13,000. (By May 2023, they had apparently been sold).

In the years since the COVID pandemic, China has established a raft of prohibitions meant to curtail the illegal pangolins trade. But as those focus mainly on pangolin meat, they have not so much dampened the trade as changed its character. Xu Ling, China coordinator for the wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic, told the Guardian that there has been a drop in the number of frozen pangolin carcasses arriving in the country for consumption as meat.  Instead, its the scales that are smuggled in, which Ling says are harvested in Africa.
And the quantities are on the uptick, a study published in Nature Conservation shows. Researcher James Kehinde Omifolaji of Federal University Dutse in Nigeria and his coauthors combed through arrest records, seizure reports, and other law enforcement data on Chinas illicit imports to reach some startling numbers. According to their research, a total of more than 400,000 pounds of pangolin scales made their way to 27 different Chinese provinces in 2021.
Pangolins are lucrative even at the point of saleor, rather, theft. Angela says that poachers in Mozambique can fetch between $450 to $750 per animal they capture and sell onto the black market.
That may not sound like much, especially considering that Mozambique legislation from May of 2017 establishes a 16-year prison sentence for traffickers, as well as fines dictated by their place in the trade. But in a country that ranks as the eighth-poorest on the Human Development Index, and where average salaries hover around about only $300 a month, the illicit trade in pangolins can seem enticing despite the punishment. Nonetheless, Angelas charges have fewer worries about smugglers than their brethren outside the park. Watching over them are more than 250 locally hired rangers trained in law enforcement, who patrol the park dismantling snares and keeping tabs on several species with the help of GPS tags. Though the system isnt fool-proof, park officials say the number of traps they find within park confines has dropped by 60 percent in recent years.
America has been a voracious client of the pangolins diamond-patterned skin, using it for high-end cowboy boots.
Because of that, Angela sees the task of her centerand of the Gorongosa Park at largeas something that encompasses more than triage. The Gorongosa park has worked hard to cultivate such community involvement. Some 200,000 people live around the refuge in what park officials call a sustainable development zone that includes education, employment opportunities, and health service. It is for these people that the 15 vets and rangers working in Angelas center have compiled a how-to guide on caring for distressed pangolins found in the wild, complete with first-aid instructions for animals rescued from poachers. The education and involvement of the community, she says, is critical. An informed public can help alert Gorongosa rangers to vulnerable pangolins located outside the haven of the park, and even point them in the direction of smuggling bands. She points out that the majority of the pangolins that her center has helped rehabilitate were brought to her doorstep by concerned local residents.
Even against long odds for all eight species of Pholidata, it is this communal tendency that gives Angela hope. Ideally, both of Angelas pangolins will eventually be fitted with GPS trackers and released into the safe haven of the parka paradise for such threatened creatures.
Picture this: On a recent late afternoon toward sunset, the baby pangolin Tembo and his older bunkmate Mercio (Angela did point out that the elder pangolins name is the male spelling of her own) wake from a day of slumber and are ready for food. Angela takes them out of their enclosure and brings them to a nearby grassy field, setting them loose to forage. African Ground Pangolins, unlike the other species, can stand upright on their hind legs, and Tembo and Mercio dosniffing the air with their sensitive noses for the scent of dinner. Recent rains have brought a bumper crop of ants, and the two burrow in the moist ground and get down to business.
Yes, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, Angela says, A light of hope that with a lot of effort and joint work it is possible to avoid the extinction of this species that is so important in Mozambique.

One of the researchers was Ben Hu, a scientist who had received significant funding from the U.S. government and whose research has focused on how coronaviruses infect humans, new reporting by the Wall Street Journal shows. 
At WIV, Hu was responsible for overseeing gain of function researchthe controversial scientific field that involves mutating viruses to make them more deadly and more contagiousinvolving coronaviruses. Gain-of-function research, which was banned in the U.S. until 2017, is typically used to develop vaccines. Hu and other scientistswhich have now been identified as Chinese researchers Yu Ping and Yan Zhuwere sickened by...something...in the fall of 2019 while working at the lab. It is unclear exactly what made Hu and other researchers ill. The Journal writes that the trio were sickened by symptoms that American officials said were consistent with either Covid-19 or a seasonal illnessto the point where the men had to be hospitalizedbut notes that it has not been definitively made public what caused the symptoms. Still, we can all agree that doesnt sound great. 
The illnesses had previously been reported on in 2021, when the Journal broke a story about researchers becoming sick at the Wuhan lab; the story was based on information received by U.S. intelligence but did not identify who had been impacted. The identities of the affected researchers remained a mystery until last week, when Public and Racket, two blogs on Substack, published a story about the incident. The story claims: 
According to multiple U.S. government officials interviewed as part of a lengthy investigation by Public and Racket, the first people infected by the virus, patients zero, included Ben Hu, a researcher who led the WIVs gain-of-function research on SARS-like coronaviruses, which increases the infectiousness of viruses.
Details about Hu and others research was also recently revealed by a transparency advocacy organization known as White Coat Waste Project. The project previously filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the government in order to pry loose documents detailing the U.S.s funding of research that went on at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The documents reveal details of the grants that were used to fund the researchers work at WIV until 2020, when President Trump shut down funding for the experiments.
According to WCW, one of the distributors of grant funding for Hus research was the U.S. Agency for International Development, while the otherand this is a twist that is sure to prove contentiouswas the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the agency that was formerly headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci served as the director of the NIAID for over two decades, beginning in 1984. He stepped down from his leadership position at the agency at the end of last year. Alternately the object of liberal adulation and rightwing conspiracy theories, Fauci served as a prominent figure in the public conversation around covid-19, and it stands to reason that his former agencys involvement wont go unnoticed here.
Altogether, the documents and the new reporting raise more questions than they answeronly serving to deepen the mystery around the origins of the worst pandemic in living memory. During the early days of covid, scientists rallied around zoonotic transmission as the most likely cause of the virus, with high-placed public health officials claiming it likely originated in the more unsanitary regions of a Wuhan wet marketperhaps via the human consumption of a pangolin or another animal. Meanwhile, speculations about covid having escaped from a lab or being the result of bioengineering were reflexively written off as the terrain of cranks and conspiracy theorists. As time passed, however, this conversation has notably shifted. Today, the lab leak hypothesis seems increasingly likely. Some government agencies have even admitted that they think its the most plausible explanation for how the virus started. Evidence for zoonotic transmission, meanwhile, has not been concretely borne out; researchers have failed to trace the virus to a particular animal.
We should hopefully know more soon. The U.S. intelligence community is obligated to declassify the information it possesses regarding potential links between the Wuhan lab and the origins of covid-19. A bill signed into law by President Biden in March mandated the declassification no later than this week.",,Gizmodo.com,Pangolin,,,0.8,0.3,Other,Other,Other,English

These big cats may leave scat or even the occasional tuft of fur in a hair snare, but their passage is often ghostly so much, in fact, that photographers are only just now capturing many aspects of their lives. In many areas, snow leopards still face conservation threats due to mining development, livestock herding and persecution from locals in their range.
Snow Leopards
The population growth prompted the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to downlist the animals from endangered to vulnerable in 2017. 
They are extremely elusive, much more elusive and harder to see than most of the other big cats, says Jan Janecka, a conservation geneticist at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.
Despite their elusive nature, however, the charismatic snow leopard is rebounding in numbers in regions like the QinghaiTibet Plateau a vast area covering parts of southwestern China and bordering countries. This is in part due to the work of local communities to improve education and tolerance.
Where Do Snow Leopards Live?
(Credit: Shutterstock/Ondrej Prosicky)
The IUCN estimates between 2,710 and 3,386 mature snow leopards exist in the wild. These are very thinly stretched across 12 countries, from southern Russia and Mongolia down to parts of India, Pakistan, Nepal and southern China.
According to work by Janecka and others, they are broadly divided into three major populations that can be considered subspecies: a northern population in parts of Russia, Mongolia, northern China and Kazakhstan; a central population in Tajikistan, Kirgizstan, Pakistan, Afghanistan and northeastern India; and a southern group in around the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
Even in areas where the population is considered relatively healthy, each solitary adult has a huge territory where they live and hunt. Some estimates put their range at as much as 193 square miles in Mongolia, though in Nepal individuals may have ranges of only a few square miles.

The population growth prompted the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to downlist the animals from endangered to vulnerable in 2017. But in many areas, snow leopards still face conservation threats due to mining development, livestock herding and persecution from locals in their range.
Snow leopards preference for extremely remote, mountainous areas has compounded the difficulty in tracking the health of their population. Are they doing badly? Or, are they just extremely hard to find, even at the best of times?

In the Chinese parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, at least, the latter seems true. While, historically, shepherds might have killed snow leopards to protect their livestock there, things have changed in the past decade or so.
They have expanded in some places where they maybe werent as abundant, Janecka says.
Part of the reason they are doing relatively well in this region may be due to recoveries prompted by stricter anti-poaching laws and enforcement in China, which hosts most of the worlds snow leopards.
In China, laws are very strict, there are severe penalties for killing a snow leopard, Janecka says. They really do hammer down on poaching and killing of the cats.
Snow Leopard Threats

Unfortunately, poaching is still an issue elsewhere. Wildlife traffickers are interested in parts of the snow leopards themselves, but the poaching of their prey also reduces the food available to the big cats, according to the Snow Leopard Trust.
They are also killed in many parts of their range due to retribution for killing livestock. The Snow Leopard Trust says that nearly half of those killed may fall in this category.
Finally, mining development, roads and other types of human infrastructure are encroaching into areas where snow leopards used to be relatively free from human influence. These roads created to reach mines and other infrastructure also help give poachers access to formerly remote areas.
Janecka has seen this happen in the Gobi Desert, where he often studies the montane predators.

Across their range, conservationists are working with new ideas to both protect snow leopards and reduce their conflict with wildlife. One of these techniques involves something like a police light:Wildlife managers use flashing foxlights to deter snow leopards from livestock areas.
In Nepal, the government compensates shepherds when snow leopards kill livestock, while the Snow Leopard Trust operates an insurance program that compensates herders in various parts of their range.
In many cases, the livestock themselves may be helping snow leopards persist in some areas. Research by Janecka and others has found that livestock comprised 31 percent of snow leopard diet in Pakistan and 15 percent in Mongolia.
Herdsman are almost providing an economic service with their livestock in way, Janecka says. So, it makes sense to compensate them when the cats prey on their animals.
How Can We Help Snow Leopards?

But livestock shouldnt necessarily be seen as a solution. While snow leopards may prey on these substitutes, the livestock encroach on the range of their native prey species like blue sheep and ibex, pushing them out of some areas.
Protection and management of regionally specific wild prey is crucial for sustaining snow leopard populations, Janecka and his coauthors wrote in the diet paper, although overall dietary breadth suggests that snow leopards may exploit other species if necessary, including livestock.
According to Janecka, working with local stakeholders will be tantamount to conservation success in all parts of their range moving forward.
One of the most important issues, currently, he says, is to try to work with these communities to reduce livestock foraging.

The Pallass cat, also known as the manul, is a stocky gray wildcat about the size of a domestic housecat. The wildcats make their homes on the high steppes and grasslands of Central Asia. Their solitary nature and remote habitat means theyre rarely spotted in the wild by humans.
Scientists have confirmed the presence of an elusive and distinctly grumpy-looking wildcat in Mount Everest. 
It is phenomenal to discover proof of this rare and remarkable species at the top of the world, Dr. Tracie Seimon of the Wildlife Conservation Societys Zoological Health Program said in a news release from the nonprofit.
Seimon was a co-leader of the research team that collected environmental samples (read: feces) from Everests slopes. Using DNA testing, they determined that scat at two different locations at 16,765 feet and 17,027 feet above sea level came from Pallass cats. 
Researchers took the samples in 2019, and a paper on their findings was published in the winter 2022 issue of the International Union for Conservation of Natures newsletter Cat News.
Pallas Cat, also known as Manul, is a small wild cat with a patchy distribution in Central Asia's grasslands and montane steppe. It is negatively threatened by habitat degradation and has been classified as ""near threatened"" by IUCN since 2002.
The discovery of Pallass cat on Everest illuminates the rich biodiversity of this remote high-alpine ecosystem and extends the known range of this species to eastern Nepal, Seimon said.
While Pallass cats arent as widely known as some feline species like their relative, the snow leopard theyve carved out an internet niche due to their unique appearance and somewhat crotchety-seeming demeanor.
Conservation biology researcher and Pallass cat enthusiast Paige Byerly celebrated the news on Twitter with an apt comment.
The idea of a Pallass cat sneering at elite climbers from behind a rock is truly warming my heart, she wrote.

Artists, thinkers, and activists around the world creatively adapt existing terminologies to describe their visions of futurism, pivoting away from the homogenizing term Indo futurism.
The wide range of perspectives that I encountered during my fellowship research share a desire to specify an inclusive language that reflects both a commitment to generational healing and a call to action to recognize and interrupt the traumas of caste and mass displacement. 
bell hooks writes, The moment we choose to love we begin to move against domination, against oppression. The moment we choose love, we begin to move towards freedom, to act in ways that liberate ourselves, and others (All About Love: New Visions, 2000). The ability to reorient and reclaim language, and to self-define, is a strategy of decolonization, an act of self-love and a step toward liberation.
The need for cultivating more expansive and loving frameworks for futurism becomes more urgent by the day. We are in the midst of a sharp rise in religious fanaticism, caste-oppression, and ethnonationalism that harms over a billion and a half people in the Indian subcontinent and across the diaspora. These tensions are exacerbated by the Indian Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019, a set of oppressions that bleed across 29 states, 8 union territories, neighboring countries and the global diaspora which numbers over 5.4 million in the United States alone. 
This exhibition aims to map a topography of South Asian futurisms, and render visible the multiple strategies used by artists to adapt and develop new futurisms, including Dalit futurism, Subaltern futurism, Queer Muslim futurism, eco-futurism and Sufi Sci-Fi futurism.
Writer and scholar Priteeghanda Naik suggests that Dalit futurism seeks to mutate caste to foreground its arbitrary structure while Dalit futurist feminismmerges intersectional, revisionist, and inclusive feminism. Though the Indian constitution officially banned caste discrimination in the 1950s, the caste system is a social contagion that pervades every aspect of life for caste-privileged and caste-oppressed individuals to this day. Caste is an ancient system of social hierarchy justified by religious Hindu texts which divides society into four varnas or categories, with Dalit and Adivasi people excluded from the ranking entirely.

Osheen Siva activates a socially-engaged pop surrealist style of artwork she frames as Tamil Dalit futurism. Her site-specific and digitally generated works present viewers neo-mythologies and speculative world-building in the form of futuristic oases and empowered figures.
Siva grew up between Taiwan, China, and Tamil Nadu, India, which is the countrys southernmost state. Her socially engaged practice is based on her family history and inspired by local communities, science fiction, comic books and the distinct aesthetics of lived environments. Murals and public art are one of my favorite mediums to explore so it is democratic. Most of the murals that I work on are based on that specific community or the area that the wall is in. It makes sense to create something for the viewers [and] for the people that are around it, she shares.  For example, the mural Protectors and Providers animates the integral role of women in the local fisherfolk community of Chennai who sustain the health of their households and economy.

While technology offers tools to visualize speculative futures and stay connected, these tools are bound up with privilege, inaccessibility, and censorship. For Siva and other artists in this exhibition it is critical that visual representations of futurisms circulate through technology and digital imaging, and also in accessible, materially based forms, such as prints, zines, and public artworks. 
When I asked Karnataka-raised Vishal Kumaraswamy why he opted for the phraseSubaltern futurism rather than Dalit futurism, he shared the work of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who coined the phrase subaltern. Dalit comes from the Sanksrit word dalani, which means broken men. The term Dalit is a mutable and contentious one. There are those who opt to use it as an act of resistance and reclamation and those who do not, opting for terms like Ambedkarite, a nod to philosopher, radical emancipatory leader, Dalit rights activist and architect of the Indian Constitution Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, or the term Bahujan, a Buddhist Pali word that means the majority of the people. Subalternindicates communities excluded from hierarchies of power, which includes caste-oppressed Dalit, Bahujan, and Adivasi people, but also draws transdiasporic and transnational parallels to marginalized groups everywhere.

Kumaraswamys four-part video Iruvu (Presence) delves into the subaltern male body as a site of struggle, subjugation and resilience who carries physical, communal, familial and emotional weight, as the video states. The main figure is on a never-ending voyage, moving through natural, digital and domestic spaces. Act I begins with a figure on the shore of a riverbank, contemplating the body of water that separates him from an unreachable shore. He moves slowly and rhythmically, as if caught underwater.  Act IV ends with a meditation and reimagination of liberatory space through the metaphor of water as well as a dismissal of the desire to access oppressive spaces, eschewing the walls youve built or your doors that keep us out. The recurring figure now moves with purpose and power.

The artist makes poignant parallels between the resistance of Black, Indigenous, and Dalit communities by engaging the liberatory teachings of Audre Lorde, bell hooks, Fred Moten, Stephanie Dinkins, B.R. Ambedkar and Mudnakudu Chinnaswamy. The film oscillates between English and Kannada, drawing a line between the perpetuated colonization of Hindi on non-Hindi speaking majority people as Hindi is wielded as a tool by the Hindu right to make falsified assertions of homogenous unity, in the artists words.

Adhavan Sundaramurthy, a trained architect from Tamil Nadu, dubs his futurist framework Tamizh Futurism. His grandfather, poet N.E. Ramalingam, taught him how to read the Tamil language one of the oldest surviving classical languages in India. Inspired by the first form of the Tamil alphabet, Vattezhuthukkal, the artist tracks the hieroglyphic evolution to 3D-renders the alphabet in the sculptural series (Alphabets). 
Ancient Tamil script was found on the temple walls of the Thanjavur Thanjavur Brihadeeshwarar temple. This is very different from the present Tamil script. (image via Wikimedia Commons)
In doing so, Sundaramurthy reanimates a longstanding history and challenges preconceived notions of indigenous language in global spaces. This language is not just something that belongs in the past, he shares. He is inspired by 6th-century Tamil poet and philosopher Kaniyan Pungundranar who wrote, Everyone in this world is my kith and kin and I am part of the world, in Poem 192 of the Sangam anthology Purananuru.

Subash Thebe Limbu presents the framework of Adivasi futurism in the Indigenous science fiction audio-visual work Ningwasum in which protagonists Miksam and Mingsoma travel back in time from a future where interplanetary civilizations are living in harmony with the Earth. The film addresses land sovereignty, differing notions of time and memory, climate change, and folkloric ritual. 
Still from Subash Thebe Limbu, NINGWASUM (2021) (photo by Manish Tamang, courtesy the artist)
Ningwasum is shot in Sherpa Nation, Yakthung Nation, and Newa (Kathmandu), and narrated entirely in Indigenous Yakthungpan, the language of the Yakthung Adivasi (Indigenous) tribe from current-day eastern Nepal. As part of Limbus process, he sought counsel with academics and elders in his community to translate the script and explore folktales, music, and traditions such as weaving of his community.

Limbu employs cultural symbols of the Yakthung (Limbu) people such as Silam Sakma, seen in the clothing, jewelry, and mothership, the vehicle which transports the characters between temporal planes. Silam Sakma is used as a cultural identifier outside of Yakthung homes and as a ritualistic object to ward off evil and bring protection during ceremonies. It is now commonly worn as a badge during significant community events and as the official indigenous organization logo. The project includes a reimagining of the ritual of Yangdang Phongma, the day when a newborn baby receives a name and blessings, and is shown the moon, the sun, and the stars for the first time by the communitys matriarchs.

While Limbu returns to his birthplace (among other neighboring regions) to invigorate queries of futurism and reimagine mythologies and folklore, Himali Singh Soin travels to the polar ends of the Earth. 
Expeditioning is in Soins blood, literally. Her father made the first Indian ascent of Mount Meru while her mother was pregnant with her.
Himali Singh Soin, we are opposite like that (2019) (image courtesy the artist)
In 2017, Soin journeyed to Antarctica and the Svalbard Arctic. These places, she found, had no Indigenous populations and therefore no mythologies. Soin ensconces herself in the anthropomorphic perspective of an epic ancestor and enduring witness: the ice. She finds kinship with the naked terracotta earth that is revealed beneath the melting ice.
Soin coined the term subcontinentment, a subversive alternate to South Asian futurisms that chronicles the geopoetic links between the poles and the subcontinent.
In her manifesto on the subject, she writes:
South Asian Futurism does not fantasize about a future / Because it cannot isolate the future from the past / It fantasizes about a life in -between South Asian Futurism dismisses its title / Denouncing South Asia as a universal region without specificity / Denouncing futurism as an accomplice / to the violence that comes with / acceleration.

We Are Opposite Like Thatis an expansive multidisciplinary series encompassing video, performance, print, and poetry. The connections that emerge tell a story of the entanglement of places, ideas, and oceanic currents. They recount the tale of the omnipresent anxiety in Victorian England that the ice of the Arctic would melt into the British Empire and render it a frozen wasteland. The mood is befitting to present-day climate grief, accompanied by dissonant soundscapes that undulate with the timber of ice. David Soin Tappeser, Soins collaborator, graphed the temperature differences between the Victorian era and present-day as well as the longitudes and latitudes of Soins journey. He then used these metrics to compose the tempo and dynamics of the string quartet. In accompanying sound installations, sounds also are recorded from Antarctica, the Arctic, and Delhi, such as the echoes of stones skimming on frozen lakes, and the tinkling of a temple dancers anklets. 
Artists including Saba Taj and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto operate from the framework of Queer Muslim futurism. In Bhuttos articles for Archer Magazine and Duke University Press, he makes the argument that Islam has always been progressive and responds to the Western medias oversimplification and vilification of the faith by expressing a distinctly queer resistance.
Saba Taj, That Which Comes Into the Night (2016), mixed media collage on wood panel, 18 inches x 24 inches (image courtesy the artist)
Bhutto extends the term queer beyond sexual preference: If we are to take queerness as being a political stance to be at odds with normative society and if the West is normalized in our globalized cultural and political discourse, then yes, islam is queer. Islam is in this sense future facing; as a faith it idealizes a world that does not yet exist. 
Mutation and hybridity serve as poignant analogies for the experience of migration and its pressures of assimilation and adaptation. Bhutto explores these intersections in his recent cyanotype works Bulhan Nameh, which charts the story of the ancient river and the Indus River dolphin, one of the worlds most endangered cetaceans.

The Indus River, a transboundary river of Asia that originates in the Himalayas, is one of the longest in the world. It is a source of life as well as the hemorrhaging point for the devastating Pakistan floods of 2022.

Critical ocean studies and our relationships with marine mammals are fertile means for exploring weathering, imagining our bodies as archives of climate and as making future climate possible to bring climate home as distant as the icecaps and as close as our own skin (Astrida Neimanis and Rachel Loewen Walker, Weathering: Climate Change and the Thick Time of Transcorporeality, 2014). In other words, ecological events do not happen around us but among us, through us, and by us. 
The ritual of weathering takes place in many stages of the artists process to create the series of installations. Bhutto travels into archival material, including Secrets of the Blind Dolphin by Dr. George Pilleri, and the river itself to survey and source material, sets up his pinhole camera to photograph, exposes the prints to sunlight on the roof of his family home, then rigorously rinses the fabrics in water until they are finally left to dry.

The ritual is simultaneously global and deeply local. I hope to re-mystify the Indus and in so doing allow us to re-imagine Her as a living and ever changing entity rather than just an exploitable resource, says Bhutto.

In recent works, Bhutto merges x-rays of his own body and bones with those of a dolphin in a journey to oneness, indicating the similarities and differences between human and aquatic species, and the fluidity between the human body and an embodied, universal ocean.

As we glean lessons from our ancestors and nonhuman living beings, we must consider futures beyond the limits of concepts like sustainability, which assume that maintaining our present circumstances is the way to survive in the future. As bell hooks said, To be truly visionary, we have to root our imagination in our concrete reality while simultaneously imagining possibilities beyond that reality. 
More than a century ago, Bengali Muslim feminist  and social reformer Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain looked beyond sustainability to regeneration in the short story Sultanas Dream. The protagonist travels across time and dimension to visit the utopia of LadyLandwherewomen have used their scientific prowess to eradicate disease, invent air travel and solar power, and maintain thriving gardens.

Artist Chitra Ganesh presents a portfolio of 27 linocuts that storyboard the sequence of Sultanas Dream, paying particular attention to the roles of the individual and the collective in effecting change.

The print form has a long history of democratic and radical political action. In her series Sultanas Dream, Ganesh employs relief printing as a metaphor for the holistic and balanced relationship that todays social and climate crises need. The artist balances the composition of multiple figures in narrative scenes, an aesthetic strategy that harmonizes the individual with the environment and foregrounds collective expression. 
Chitra Ganesh, Sultanas Dream: Wise Ladies Meeting Linocut Print in Process(2018) (image courtesy the artist and Durham Press)
This series comes after a turning point in Ganeshs practice where she began to consider how to explore mythic frameworks that shift from being anchored in Hindu iconography, a visual grammar that has unfortunately and dangerously been weaponized by the Hindu right. 
What would Hossain have written now, were she still alive, to see that we have moved further away from ecological regeneration rather than closer to it? What would she have prayed for at Saks Afridis SpaceMosque if she knew that one of her prayers would come true?
Saks Afridi is a self-described Sufi Sci-Fi futurist who fuses Islamic mysticism and futurism to meditate on belonging amid transnationalism.
He offers SpaceMosqueas a retrofuturist parafiction. A spectacular vessel arrives from the future, granting all humans on Earth one prayer every 24 hours. The vessel is a prayer portal that manifests in many iterations, utilizing a divine algorithm to adjust its appearance to the seeker. Prayer becomes the ultimate currency, leading to both great miracles and great tragedies, until the SpaceMosque disappears.

I wonder what my grandmother would pray for. 
As a child, she used to visit the Ganges River every morning with her grandfather who would perform ablution for Fajr prayer. She could not join herself due to strict purdah the separation between men and women. 
If she were to be transported back to Bihar, how different would the river look a near-century later?  What will that place look like a century from now? A millennium? 
What would she see, with her one good eye?

White-tailed deer dart through softwood stands of pine and hemlock, bucks and does, the last leaping fawn, leaving tracks that look like tiny human lungs, trails that people can only ever see in the snow, even though, long after snowmelt, dogs can smell them, tracking, snuffling, shuddering with the thrill of the hunt and noshing on deer scat for dog treats. I make lists of finds, two-winged, four-footed, and rolling: black-throated green warblers and blue-headed vireos, porcupines and salamanders, tin cans and old tires, deer mice and fisher cats, wild turkeys and ruffed grouse, black bears and, come spring, their tumbling, potbellied, big-eared cubs.
Even if you havent been to the woods lately, you probably know that the forest is disappearing. In the past ten thousand years, the Earth has lost about a third of its forest, which wouldnt be so worrying if it werent for the fact that almost all that loss has happened in the past three hundred years or so. As much forest has been lost in the past hundred years as in the nine thousand before. With the forest go the worlds within those woods, each habitat and dwelling place, a universe within each rotting log, a galaxy within a pine cone. And, unlike earlier losses of forests, owing to ice and fire, volcanoes, comets, and earthquakesactuarially acts of Godnearly all the destruction in the past three centuries has been done deliberately, by people, actuarially at fault: cutting down trees to harvest wood, plant crops, and graze animals.
The Earth is about four and a half billion years old. By about two and a half billion years ago, enough oxygen had built up in the atmosphere to support multicellular life, and by about five hundred and seventy million years ago the first complex macroscopic organisms had begun to appear, as Peter Frankopan reports in The Earth Transformed (Knopf), an essential epic that runs from the dawn of time to, oh, six oclock yesterday. In his not at all cheerful conclusion, looking to a possibly not too distant future in which humans fail to address climate change and become extinct, Frankopan writes, Our loss will be the gain of other animals and plants. An upside!
The first trees evolved about four hundred million years ago, and pretty quickly, geologically speaking, they covered most of the Earths dry land. A hundred and fifty million years later, during a mass-extinction event known as the Great Dying, the forests perished, along with nearly everything else on land and sea. Then, two million years after that, the supercontinent broke up, a seismic process whose consequences included depositing oil, coal, and natural gas in the places on the planet where they can still be found, to our enrichment and ruination. The trees returned. The ginkgo is the oldest surviving tree species, its fan-shaped leaves unfurling lime green in spring and falling, mustard yellow, in autumn.
The first primates showed up about fifty-five million years ago, in the rain forest. They lived in the trees. Our ancestors began dividing from apesbegan, slowly, coming down from the treesabout seven million years ago; the genus Homo branched off four million years later; and Homo sapiens began wandering around the understory somewhere between eight hundred thousand and two hundred thousand years ago, although exactly when is apparently a matter of fierce debate, which seems right, since humans are such a contentious, Neanderthal-killing lot. Heres how Frankopan, a professor of global history at Oxford, puts it: Like rude house guests who arrive at the last minute, cause havoc and set about destroying the house to which they have been invited, human impact on the natural environment has been substantial and is accelerating to the point that many scientists question the long-term viability of human life. Climate change contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals about thirty-five thousand years ago, but humans, instead of dying out, migrated to different climates, or found other ways to survive, which generally involved controlling fire and burning fallen sticks and branches for heat and to cook otherwise hard-to-digest food, or making axes to cut down trees, whose wood could be used to build shelters and, later, fences for animals. They cut and felled. Knopf printed about twenty thousand copies of Frankopans seven-hundred-page book on paper made from trees. I read it sitting in a house built of pine in a chair made of maple at a desk made of oak holding a pencil made of cedar. They cut and felled. The wood in my woodstove is yellow birch, burning, bark curling.
If you think about it, a tree is a tricky place in which to live, the biologist Roland Ennos writes in The Age of Wood (Scribner). Ennos argues that dividing human history into the Stone Age (beginning two and a half million years ago), the Bronze Age (30001000 B.C.E.), and the Iron Age (1200300 B.C.E.)a scheme invented in the nineteenth century by a Danish antiquarianmisses the earliest and most important era, the Wood Age.
People are arboreal, at least vestigially, Ennos points out, with binocular vision, upright posture, hind limbs for movement, forelimbs for gripping, and fingers with soft pads and nails, all features that evolved to help primates live in trees. The first primates were as small as mice, and could scramble wherever they liked, but, as they got bigger, it became harder to stay up in the trees, where it was safest, especially at night. A clambering hypothesis, among primatologists, has it that the thinking of great apes got more sophisticatedthey developed a self-reflective psychologyso that they could better understand the mechanics of climbing and swinging through trees. Also, the first tools used by great apes were made of trees and in trees: nests for sleeping in higher branches. (The bigger your brain, the more REM sleep you need.) The earliest hominins who learned to walk upright did so while still living, mainly, in trees, and they came down at night only after figuring out how to make fireswith wood. That had all kinds of knock-on effects, including being able to cook food, which makes it easier for us to get energy out of it, and made it possible for our brains to grow bigger. Hominins came down from the trees, built huts, made fires, and no longer needed their fur, so they lost it, which meant that when the weather, or the climate, got colder they needed warmer huts and more fires, but with those they could go anywhere, as long as there were trees. As for making tools, they mainly used not stone but wood, and when they did use stone it was often to make better tools out of wood. You could use a stone, for instance, to sharpen a wooden spear, a tool you could wield to kill beasts of land and sea.
In all this time, people did not run out of wood, since there werent that many people and there were a great many trees, and because trees grow back. Even after humans invented the stone axe and began to chop down trees, this was still true. Chopping and burning, they cleared openings in forests to attract game, and they adzed trunks and limbs into poles and posts, planks and beams. They built houses and rafts and boats, and some people, in places where they had cleared the forests, began to farm. During the ages of stone, bronze, and iron, down through the early modern era, Ennos writes, almost all the possessions of everyday folk were wooden, while those that were not actually made of wood needed large quantities of wood to produce. Only the turn to coal for fuel in the eighteenth century and to wrought iron for building in the nineteenth, he argues, brought about the end of the age of wood. Except that it didnt exactly end, since imperialism, industrialism, and capitalism meant that people were more likely to go to war and conquer land in order to cut down other peoples trees.",,The New Yorker,Tree Fern,,,0.7,0.95,"Wildlife, Climate and Energy, Forests",Other,Other,English

Thought to be the only one of its kind, the panda was filmed going about its business in the Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan Province.
The albino giant panda is believed to be about five or six years old and does not appear to be suffering from any health problems, according to Chinas state broadcaster CCTV.
The bear was originally discovered by the cameras in 2019, although had not been seen since until now. It was found interacting with other black and white pandas. Like many albino animals, the panda also has distinctive red eyes.
Reserve authorities had since set up a special team to monitor the panda. The researchers studied the bears possible routines and installed and adjusted motion-activated cameras to capture its movements.
Most of the time, giant pandas sport their distinctive black and white bands of colour. However, between the years of 1985 and 2021, researchers in China discovered a small group of 10 all-brown giant pandas in the wild.
Li Sheng, a researcher at Peking Universitys School of life sciences, told CCTV that this was the first recorded footage of an albino giant panda in the wild.
“It is still unclear whether its gene will be inherited and steadily passed on in the small panda population, and more follow-up research is needed,” he said.
It’s always exciting when wildlife cameras spot unusual behaviour or rare animals, just like when this photographer set up a camera trap at the wildlife watering hole to see what he could capture.

Now, he's raised $20 million to open new restaurants with plans to steal market share from McDonald's.","Next Level Burger, founded in 2014 by a former oil-and-gas VC executive and backed by Whole Foods, plans to triple in size with its latest funding.",https://www.businessinsider.com/plant-based-chain-next-level-burger-announces-20-million-raise-2022-9,https://i.insider.com/6320cb9be8b5000018510f48?width=1200&format=jpeg,2022-12-22T16:45:43Z,"Editors note: This story was originally published in September 2022. 
By 30, Matthew de Gruyter, an oil-and-gas venture capitalist, had made his first $1 million. The father of two could indulge in the finer things in life, living in the wealthy suburbs of Orange County, California, and driving a red BMW M3 race car.
He said he could also afford to live a ""cleaner"" life. He'd given up red meat in 2010, after his mother died of cancer at 56. De Gruyter, then 27, reflected on his weekly diet of steaks, Whoppers, and meat burritos; he estimates he ate several pounds of red meat a week. De Gruyter said the switch to a plant-based diet made him stronger, more energetic, and less stressed at work.
But as he examined his work and personal ethos, de Gruyter realized he was a walking contradiction: He was eating a plant-based diet to help cut carbon emissions while profiting from the billion-dollar oil-and-gas sector.
""It does not get more antithetical than going from oil and gas and drilling wells in the earth and polluting the planet to the sustainability that is inherent in pushing anything plant-based,"" de Gruyter told Insider.
In his quest to align his career with this diet, he quit his job and launched a restaurant serving plant-based burgers in 2014. The quinoa-and-mushroom-based burgers were created from recipes by his wife, Cierra. Eventually, the brand caught the eye of two key investors: Whole Foods Market and Alex Payne, who was an early Twitter employee. Both became early backers of de Gruyter's brand, Next Level Burger, which has grown to nine restaurants in six states.
The restaurant chain announced a $20 million raise on Tuesday, led by Payne and his wife, Nicole Brodeur. Next Level plans to use the funds to reach 28 locations by 2025.
De Gruyter's goals in the fast-growing sector are lofty: take share away from McDonald's by becoming a brand that people flock to because its burgers are not only good for the environment but delicious and affordable.
""We want to make the question not 'Why would you eat plant-based?' to 'Why wouldn't you?'"" he said.
Next Level Burger patties are made of quinoa and mushrooms. The chain also has a burger made with Beyond Meat.
Next Level Burger
Whole Foods took the chain to the next level
De Gruyter quit his VC job in 2013 and moved his family to Bend, Oregon, to launch Next Level Burger.
The startup, bootstrapped from the money he'd made investing in the oil-and-gas sector, opened in the summer of 2014. Central Oregon proved to be the perfect place to test the prototype.
""It is a Shangri-La of skiing and snowboarding, mountain biking and kayaking, hiking and climbing,"" de Gruyter said.
Serendipity played a significant role in its expansion. De Gruyter said that two months after opening, Payne and Brodeur walked into Next Level Burger.
De Gruyter said Payne and Brodeur, who invests in early-stage vegan and sustainable-change companies, made a ""seven-figure"" investment in Next Level. The backing allowed de Gruyter to open a second restaurant in Portland in October 2015, where he said the ""lines were out the door for days"" after its opening.
The Portland success put Next Level on the radar of Whole Foods Market. In July 2016, the two companies partnered to put the plant-based-burger joint inside a Whole Foods 365 store in Lake Oswego, an affluent Portland suburb. Eventually, Whole Foods became Next Level's ""biggest investor"" with a minority stake, said de Gruyter, who remains the majority stakeholder.
The investment was crucial to Next Level's growth. Six of Next Level's nine restaurants are in Whole Foods stores in Oregon, Texas, New York, California, and Washington.
""Without trailblazers such as Whole Foods and others, the world wouldn't have been ready for NLB in 2014,"" de Gruyter said.
Next Level plans to go after McDonald's
De Gruyter, who turns 40 on Tuesday, estimated that 80% of Next Level's customers ""are flexitarian and are not vegan or vegetarian.""
""And we love to feed vegans and vegetarians,"" he added, ""but at the end of the day, you don't get too far preaching to the choir.""
These diners have options. Next Level is not the only vegan or plant-based restaurant chain in the US; other chains include Veggie Grill, Plant Power Fast Food, and PLNT Burger, which have about 50 locations in total. The comedian Kevin Hart recently launched a vegan fast-food restaurant, Hart House, in Los Angeles.
De Gruyter said he views other plant-based chains not as threats but as allies. ""Anyone pushing climate change in the right direction, anyone pushing sustainability in the right direction I see as on our side of the field,"" he said.
However, fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Panda Express, and KFC that have added plant-based burgers and chicken to their menus are a different story.
""I'm much more interested in taking market share away from the McDonald's and the Red Robins of the world,"" he said.",business-insider,Business Insider,Red Panda,,,0.8,0.7,"Climate and Energy, Governance, Other",Other,,English

Examining the trunk of the tree, he extracted a strand of tiger fur, left behind when the cat leaned its belly against the tree while clawing it. Santosh had already pointed out fresh tiger tracks on our walk through the forest. The only protection Santosh and his fellow guide, Asbin, had brought were wooden staffs about 5 feet long. It is a measure of the utter faith in my guides that I had developed that I was not worried about becoming a tigers meal. Indeed, my only concern was whether I was going to spot a big catalas, I did not. 
In my three days at the parka former royal hunting ground that became Nepals first national park in 1973 and was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984I had gradually shed some of my 21st-century urban habits and learned to experience the tropical surroundings with more acute hearing, vision, and smell. My guide had a startling ability to discern a distant and indistinct shape as the back of a greater one-horned rhinoceros, or to spot a bird in flight and immediately peg it as a greater hornbill, or to I.D. a rustle in the bushes as a wild boar (which soon crossed our path). To be shown how to be a more perceptive wanderer in the forest was a great gift.

And I experienced similar gains in perception throughout my ten days in Nepal on a personalized tour arranged by &amp;Beyond, the experiential travel company that offers forward-thinking travelers curated experiences at locations in Africa, South America, and south Asia. While the accommodations were all first rate, and the food delicious and plentiful, the experiences were sometimes challengingphysically, emotionally, and even philosophically. But it was the best kind of challenge, and the guides invariably were there to explain, to lead, to fan ones curiosity. For the habitually curious person, this is travel at its best.
Nepals Diverse Landscapes and Culture
The trip featured Kathmandu as the home base, starting with two nights in Dwarikas Hotel, followed by a three-night excursion north into the foothills of the Himalayas to stay at the Happy House, a small inn in the town of Phaplu, at an elevation just below 9,000 feet. Then a return to Kathmandu for a night, and on to Chitwan in the south to stay at the Taj Resort Meghauli Serai, and finally back to Kathmandu for more sightseeing before returning home. 
What I did not know when I set out was how distinct each of the three areas were, each with their own topography, religious practices, local vocabulary, and ethnic stocks. Nepal is a country that ranges from the heights of Mt. Everest through the ancient trading routes across the Kathmandu Valley and down to the Terai plain where Chitwan National Park lies, nearly at sea level. 
Dwarikas is a story in itselfthe eponymous founder became fascinated with the exquisite wood carving done by the Newarsthe dominant ethnic group in the Kathmandu Valley­­and in the 1950s started to salvage carved window- and door-frames from demolished buildings. By 1970 he was ready to start building. Today, the hotel has 80 rooms, with 40 more under construction. Although the hotels origin is recent, the look is in keeping with traditional Newari design, each room lovingly decorated with the work of local artisansa pleasing meld of wood, terra cotta, stone, and fabric. 
Soon after my arrival, I met Ramesh Acharya who was to be my guide that day in Kathmandu. We set out for a UNESCO heritage site called Pashupati. As the driver negotiated the traffic, Ramesh announced that our first stop there would be the ghats along the Bagmati river, where after death Hindus are bathed in water and milk and then cremated, a ritual cleansing to purify them for passage into the next life. We stood on one side of the river while on the other side families, friends, and neighbors mourned and attendants tended the fires, occasionally adding wet rice straw to the top of a pyre to concentrate the heat. Ramesh explained that for poor families, the $150 cost of the pine logs could be a harsh expenseand that wealthier families, who undertook their ceremonies a bit upstream, might pay four times that to secure sweeter-burning sandalwood. 
It was, for a traveler unmoored by jet lag, a challenging opening scene. But the gentle seriousness with which Ramesh explained the rites and their purposes overcame my initial discomfort as it became clear that if I meant to understand Nepal, I had to try to understand this. 
Our next stop was one of Kathmandus most important Buddhist sites, the Boudhanath Stupa. A stupa is a hemispherical mound, usually containing some holy relic. The Boudhanath Stupa (another UNESCO site) is a bright white dome, surmounted by a golden spire. Visitors hoping to enhance their karma take buckets filled with water and saffron blossoms and fling the contents in a series of arcs across the white dome, creating a pattern like a lotus blossom, symbol of purity and spiritual awakening. The stupa is surrounded by a ring of brick buildings that have grown up around it over the centuries, now occupied by souvenir shops, guest houses, restaurants, and a Tibetan Buddhist temple in which monks were chanting solemnly to percussive accompaniment.  
We moved from the sacred to the secular after that, driving to the nearby city of Bhaktapur, which along with Kathmandu and a third city, Patan, dominate the valley and hold great examples of the arts and crafts of the Newars. Each city has a Durbar (Royal) Square, where temples and a royal palace provide a focus for public life. In Bhaktapur, the palace is called the 55-window Palace, and displays the sort of exquisite wood carving that inspired Dwarika to build his hotel. Nearby Pottery Square displays samples of one of the distinctive crafts of the Newars, and along the way, local metalsmiths offer singing bowls. 
The next day, I was to proceed to the Happy House.
Hearty Hikes from Happy House
At Kathmandu airport I met Ang Tshering Lama, who would be host, guide, and interpreter of many things in the next three days in Phaplu, at the well-named Happy House. This guest house offers hikes of varying difficulties as well as wellness experiences, tasty meals around a common table, and the thinner, rarer air of the Himalayan foothills. Our trip to Phaplu was by a small helicopter. As we headed northwest from Kathmandu, we slipped in and out of clouds as we skirted the tops of ever-higher hills, many terraced to make room for small fields upon which  grow millet, buckwheat, and other crops.  After about 40 minutes in the air, we landed at Phaplu on a postage stamp of an airstrip a short walk from the Happy House. 
Its name refers to time spent there and in the vicinity by Sir Edmund Hillary, who with his Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay was the first to summit Everest (at least, the first we know ofsome believe that George Mallory and Sandy Irvine did reach the summit in 1924 before their deaths, but there is no proof for this). Hillarys fondness for the area and his gratitude to the Sherpa people led him to found both a school and a hospital nearbyAng was born in that hospital.

But Angs familys experience of the place has not been entirely happy. Between 1996 and 2006, Nepal was riven by a slow-burning civil war between Maoist rebels and the royal government of Nepal. In the fall of 2001, Maoist forces launched attacks on government assets in 42 provinces, and Angs father, who was mayor of the village, was targeted. A friend heard of the plot and sent a warning, and when the Maoists came, Angs parents hid under the floorboards of the main room of the Happy House. The next day they fled, eventually coming to the U.S., where they now live. In 2006 a negotiated settlement ended the war, and in 2007 the monarchy was abolished. Ang, who attended college in New York, eventually returned to Phaplu and in 2017 began restoring the house, which opened to guests in 2018.
The rooms are uncluttered and of ample size, with delightfully comfortable beds, rendered even more comfy by the hot-water bottle one discovers between the sheets. I turned in that first night after a lovely afternoonone shaped, but not dampened, by the rain that arrived not long after we landed in Phaplu. I indulged in a massage in a yurt in the backyard, warmed by a fire in the wood stove and serenaded by the rain thrumming on the canvas roof. At dinner, I found a wonderfully interesting assortment of other guests. As we were served local specialties we got acquainted and grew into a merry band, doubtless helped by the waitstaff, who ensured that no wine glass went unfilled. 
The next day, after an alfresco breakfast, some of us were taken by 4WD truck up primitive roads to the Thupten Choeling monastery, an important place for the Buddhists who started coming to this part of Nepal from Tibet centuries ago, and who came in great numbers after the bloody Chinese crackdown on Tibet in 1959. We shed our shoes and entered a room in which dozens of monks and nuns were chanting. I sat down and tried to enter the spirit of the place. A young woman visitor seated next to me asked if I know how to meditate. I nodded. Then she said, This is the most powerful place on earth.

Soon they broke for lunch, and we headed downstairs to tour the kitchen. We were told there were about 500 monks and nuns there, and the kitchen contained a huge wood-fired stove with enormous pots in which the vegetarian meals are cooked. We hiked down from the monastery, through forest and farmland, beside a river, and to the town of Junbesi for a simple lunch. Then we returned to the Happy House, for an evening of more food (and for me, less winealtitude must be respected). 
Having acclimated to the height a bit, we were led the next day on a hike up to the Chiwong monastery. Ang went with us, as did a couple of staff folks to carry supplies and make sure we all arrived safely. (Later, I learned that the young man leading the line had summited Everest twice and has also climbed a number of other famous peaks; Ang himself, we learned, climbed Everest last year.) 
Hiking up from Happy House we traversed small fields, crossed into woods filled with blooming rhododendron trees. I had heard that one of the Happy House dogs (there are many, who recline in contentment around the inns grounds) had scars from tangling with a local leopard. What kind of leopard? Ang was asked. A common leopard. Of course, this was to distinguish it from the famous snow leopard. But to a person hiking the trail with nothing better than a battered trekking pole to defend himself with, the notion that any kind of leopard could be called common here was unsettling. No leopards were spotted. 
Arriving at the monastery, we learned it was founded by Angs great-great-great grandfather in 1923. It had suffered considerable damage in the 2015 earthquake, and signs of ongoing repairs were widespread. The walls are adorned with Buddhist art, and Ang patiently and passionately explains the stories and theology behind the symbolism of the paintings. When he finished, one member of the group said, I learned more about Buddhism in the past half hour than I did in a full-semester course on the topic in college. 
Natural Wonders With Luxury Accommodations
The next morning it was back to Kathmandu, and then the following morning a short flight south to Chitwan National Park. At the Meghauli Serai resort we left frantic Nepali roads behind and entered a tranquil oasis where curving paths and thoughtful landscaping unfolded a variety of environments and accommodations. I was taken to my room, a River Villa. The villa is large, with indoor and outdoor showers, a bathtub, a huge, canopied bed, and a private swimming pool. Bed and pool overlook the Rapti River, where (across the stream) the next morning a mother and baby greater one-horned rhinoceros would be taking their morning constitutional.
But upon arrival, it was time for a quick lunch (the food sourced from local farms and rivers) and then to be briefed by Santosh on the history and wildlife of the park. The afternoons focus was on a boat ride along the river, where we saw crocodiles, cranes, langur monkeys, and one of the parks stars, the severely endangered gharial, a toothy fish-eating crocodilian that can grow to nearly 20 feet in length. 
That evening, in a small clearing on the property, guests were entertained by local musicians and dancers performing the music of the Kumal, an ethnic group famed for their pottery.  The resort encourages strengthening local traditions and cultures by providing audiences and support for the groups. 
The next morning, I joined Santosh for a three-hour drive through the park. There are three distinct environments in the parkgrasslands (a favorite haunt of the rhinos), riverine forest, and the sal forest that makes up the great majority of the domain. The sal forest is named for the sal tree, which furnishes the lumber that so richly adorns the facades of royal palaces, and temples (and Dwarikas Hotel). Spotted deer are common in the forests and are the favorite item in the diet of the tiger. At first I felt like a hopeless city slicker (which I doubtless am), as Santosh quickly sighted and identified all manner of bird and beast. I juggled camera and binoculars trying to keep up, and too often failed to spot the critter in question. But slowly, my senses sharpened, and by the end of the expedition, I was able to track his sightings of rhinos, birds, and other park denizens.
After the mornings explorations, my sampling of the resorts amenities continued with a lovely 90-minute massage, and then the drive and dine experience, which took me to lunch with Binny Sebastian, the resorts general manager, by a river in the local community foresta park borderland where local residents are allowed to gather items they formerly would have found inside the park. Lunch was followed by a drive through the forest where more deer, fantastically colored birds, and monkeys witnessed our progress. 
On the next mornings walking safari, Santosh pointed out, in addition to the tigers claw marks, the horizontal slash marks of the sloth bear (a true bear, with long claws like those of the sloth) on an embankment where the bear foraged for grubs, and later noted other scratch marks on a tree that showed where a spotted deer had rubbed the velvet off its horns to toughen them up. 
In the afternoon, Santosh took me for a quick visit to a local Tharu village. The traditional Tharu dwellings have walls fashioned of upright stands of elephant grass, braced with horizontal bamboo poles, and cemented together with a mortar of mud and dung. The homes are painted with traditional decorations, including comma-shaped patterns in alternating blue and pink, which Santosh noted were made by dipping the heel of a closed fist in paint and pressing it against the wall. 
The last night in Meghauli Serai featured a dinner at another outdoor space on the property, with entertainment by an impressive ensemble of Tharu musicians and dancers. My trip ended back in Kathmandu with visits to more sights in Patan and the capital, and then the journey home. 
Thanks to the care with which &amp;Beyond had planned my itinerary and selected its guides, the experience of Nepal I had was far more intense and affecting than I had anticipated. I had traveled there expecting to see marvelous things, as I did. But I had not expected to be inspired to think as much or as seriously about local religious practices and beliefs, or to get such a visceral sense of the countrys recent history, or such an intimate immersion in its different ecosystems. I ended my trip feeling a bit tired, but it was the tiredness that comes from a worthwhile exertion, and savored more of achievement than of fatigue. 
The morning I left the Happy House, in the middle of my trip, three of my new friends were setting off on a three-day hike (accompanied by guides and porters) that would take them to a summit with a glorious view of the highest part of the Himalayan chain, including Mt. Everest itself. On the last morning of my trip, back in Kathmandu, I ran into two of them at breakfast at Dwarikas. They told me of their climb, its incidents and challenges, and showed me a photo taken at the summit of their climb, with vast white peaks shining in the distance. 
I was sorry to have missed it, but it gives me ample reason to return. And maybe next time I will see a tiger, too.

These are the highest non-technical mountains hikers can summit.,https://matadornetwork.com/read/non-technical-mountains/,https://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2023/06/shutterstock_124323109-1.jpg,2023-06-28T18:00:00Z,"For hikers, the idea of becoming a technical mountain climber can be as intimidating. Luckily, not all summits demand technical training. Below are nine formidable peaks that range from 14,000 to 24,000 feet and are accessible to hikers. Theyre not exactly casual strolls, but if youre an experienced trekker, these are some of the most impressive non-technical mountains you can climb.
Lenin Peak, Kyrgyzstan 23,406 feet
Lenin Peaks summit is only about 5,500 feet lower in elevation than Mount Everests, which seems like a big difference until you consider how colossal both peaks are, and how much they tower over world-famous mountains are half their size. Located on the Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan border, Lenin Peak is the highest summit in the Trans-Alai Range and the easiest to climb of Central Asias 7,000-plus-meter (23,000-plus feet) summits. There are more than a dozen routes to the top of Lenin Peak. The North Face Route is the safest, most accessible, and most popular. How long the climb takes varies, but ascents typically require at least three weeks.
Aconcagua, Argentina 22,838 feet
Located in Argentinas Andes, Aconcagua is the highest peak in the Western Hemisphere and the second-highest of the Seven Summits (a term peak-baggers use to describe the highest mountain on each continent) after Everest. Despite being considered the highest non-technical mountain in the world, climbers should be equipped with mountaineering gear such as crampons and ice axes to navigate ice, snow, and glaciers. The most popular route, which may be referred to as the Normal or Northwest Route, usually takes between 12 and 14 days to complete. More challenging non-technical routes, such as the Polish Glacier Traverse, may take up to 20 days and require more advanced mountaineering skills. Climbers who choose this route will need to cross a steep glacier to get to the summit hence the need for crampons although no technical skills such as rock or ice climbing are required.
Ojos del Salado, Chile 22,614 feet
Chiles highest peak, and the tallest volcano on Earth, Ojos de Salado is a dormant Andean volcano that towers over the Chile-Argentina border. The ascent to the summit typically takes between 9 and 15 days depending on whether you approach from the Chilean side or the Argentinian side, which is longer and more challenging. Ojos de Salado is considered non-technical because the majority of the ascent is a hike, although the final stretch involves a more technical scramble. Youll need to obtain a permit and complete an acclimatization program if you depart from the Chilean side whereas the Argentinian side requires no permit. 
Mera Peak, Nepal 21,247 feet
Mera Peak is located in Nepals Sagarmth region, the same Himalayan expanse that houses Mount Everest. In fact, its fewer than 10 miles from Everest as the crow flies, offering non-technical climbers some of the best views of the worlds highest mountain that theyll ever see. High-altitude trekking experience is helpful to summit Mera Peak, which involves everything from hiking through forests and crossing suspension bridges to hiking through glacial fields and crossing crevasses. The ascent usually takes around two weeks. Climbers should come prepared with mountaineering gear such as crampons to ensure a successful summit, despite the fact that Mera Peak is considered a non-technical trekking peak.
Stok Kangri, India 20,187 feet
Many climbers view Stok Kangri located in Indias Ladakh region, or the land of high passes as the perfect non-technical mountain to ease into Himalayan mountaineering. The highest mountain in the Stok range, the peak falls within Hemis National Park, which is otherwise known for having a large snow leopard population. Trekkers flock to the peak during the summer when the weather is favorable, although nighttime temperatures can dip below freezing. There are multiple ways to reach the summit, all of which start and end in Ladakhs largest city, Leh. On a clear day, Stok Kangri summiters will get a glimpse of other famous peaks, including K2.
Kilimanjaro, Tanzania 19,340 feet
Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is a common ambition for hikers. Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa and the fourth-tallest of the Seven Summits one that climbers can tackle with only sturdy hiking boots, trekking poles if you like them, apparel and accessories for cold and rainy weather, and other multi-day hiking basics. There are several routes to the top, which generally range from five to nine days of hiking. The relatively gentle Marangu (Coca-Cola) Route and slightly more challenging Machame (Whiskey) Route are the most popular routes. Umbwe is the shortest and steepest route to the summit. Which path you choose not only determines the length and difficulty of the trek but also how much of the mountain you get to see and how much time you have to acclimatize to the altitude, which is arguably the greatest obstacle Kilimanjaro and other high-altitude non-technical mountains.
Mount Elbrus, Russia 18,510 feet
The fifth-tallest of the Seven Summits, and the final one on this list, Mount Elbrus is located in Russias Caucasus Mountains, qualifying it as the tallest peak in Europe. There are two main routes for climbing Mount Elbrus: the non-technical Normal Route, which starts in the town of Terskol on the southern side of the mountain, and the Northern Route, which involves steeper slopes, more technical climbing over rock and ice, and more exposure to harsh weather conditions and higher altitude. The Normal Route typically takes four to six days to complete, depending on the pace of the climbers and weather conditions. Its a challenging climb in a harsh high alpine environment, but the effort is well worth the spectacular views and cultural experiences if you choose to visit nearby villages and towns along the way.
Mount Kenya, Kenya 17,058 feet
Africas second-highest peak, Mount Kenya is both a non-technical mountain and one of the most scenic vantage points on the continent, with views spanning from the Great Rift Valley to Mount Kilimanjaro across the Tanzanian border. The scenery is spectacular as you ascend through forests, grasslands, glaciers, and a variety of other terrain. Mount Kenya has not one but three main summits: Lenana, Nelion, and Batian. Today, most climbers follow the Sirimon Route starting on the northwest side of the mountain and complete the trek in four or five days. 
Mount Whitney, California 14,494 feet
Mount Whitney is significantly smaller than many of the summits on this list, but its the highest mountain in the contiguous United States, and many peak-baggers consider climbing any mountain over 14,000 feet colloquially, a Fourteener to be a brag-worthy achievement. Located in eastern Californias Sierra Nevada range, Whitneys summit marks the boundary between Sequoia National Park and Inyo National Forest. The most popular approach to the summit is the Whitney Portal Trailhead, which typically takes two to three days to complete but requires nothing more than sturdy hiking boots, warm clothing, and a permit to climb the peak. That said, climbers should expect to scramble over a rocky ridge during the final stretch and be prepared for high winds, high altitude, and unpredictable weather.",,Matadornetwork.com,Snow Leopard Nepal,,,0.1,0.8,"Wildlife, Climate and Energy, Forests, Other",Other,"Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia), Other",English

In dark, tannic waters, Zhou has created a striking composition capturing this rarely photographed and endangered species , the judges declared. This is by far the best image we've ever seen of this species, whose numbers are declining at an alarming rate.
The full set of UPY 2023 results can be seen in the Winners' gallery
Boto Encantado, Overall Winner, Underwater Photographer of the Year 2023 and Up &amp; Coming category, ... [+] Amazonia Brazil.

According to the legend among locals, river dolphins (botos) can transform at night into handsome men known as boto encantado to seduce women. Though I did not witness this elusive boto transformation at dusk , I was enchanted by these beautiful mammals in a different way, said Zhou.
After seeing how botos would sometimes bring their beaks above water, I knew I want a split shot at sunset. Though the water was so dark that I was shooting blind, this dolphin gave me a perfect pose and smile.
As indigenous communities settled by rivers in the Amazon, river dolphins began living in closer proximity to human populations, even making use of food scraps. Frequent dolphin sightings led to tales like boto encantado. But theres a darker side to the legend, as it has often been used to excuse pregnancies after women were assaulted or forced into prostitution.
While botos are generally revered as mythical creatures, many scorned husbands have killed dolphins because of these stories. Furthermore, many river dolphins are killed for use as fish bait. Despite being banned legally, the practice has not been eradicated.
Alongside other even bigger dangers like mercury poisoning from the gold mining industry and large development projects that have disrupted the river ecosystems, I fear that botos are in the way to truly become no more than mythical creatures, Zhou said.

We arrived at Stingray City on Grand Cayman before dawn so as to capture the morning light and undisturbed sand ripples, said J. Gregory Sherman. Just as the sun broke in the horizon, a line of southern stingrays headed straight for me and I captured this image as they glided across the sand.
Crowd Control, Runner Up, Wide Angle Category, Norway

A female orca swimming through a bait ball of herring, turning it into a donut.
I've been traveling to Northern Norway for the past five winters to witness one of our planet's most spectacular wildlife events, the herring migration into the fjords which attracts large number of orcas and humpback whales, said Andy Schmid.
Orcas are the oceans apex predator, feeding on everything from sharks to whales. In Arctic Norway, they target bait-balls of nutritious, egg-filled herring. The action is ephemeral and fast moving, the conditions some of the toughest for a photographer.
Sky Full Of Ray, third place, Wide Angle category, Mexico, La Paz, Baja California Sur
Photo: Rafael Fernandez Caballero, Spain - UPY 2023 
The most similar sensation to seeing a sky full of birds when underwater is undoubtedly the feeling of being below a large mobula aggregation of stingrays, the photographer said.
This incredible show of nature in the Sea of Cortez occurs during spring time. I dived down, holding my breath and waited until hundreds of rays unexpectedly passed over my head.
Kelp forest gold', Highly Commended, Wide Angle category, California, U.S.
Photo: Douglas Klug U.S - UPY 2023
Garibaldi are protected from fishing due to their status as Californias official state Marine Fish.
Under the right conditions, theyre quite interactive with divers. For this image, I was diving in a shallow, sunlit kelp forest with near perfect conditions when this young adult took interest with its own reflection in the dome port of my camera,said Douglas Klug. The fish spent nearly half an hour making close passes and hovering in front of my dome port as the oceans energy moved the kelp around, creating a light show with the shifting beams of sunlight from above.
Garibaldis, overgrown and glowing orange damselfish, are iconic residents of kelp forests.
Brought by the current, Commended, Wide Angle category, Mikomoto island, Japan
Photo Masayuki Agawa U.S - UPY 2023
A warm current known as the Kuroshio around Japan changed its course a few years ago and has been sending huge schools of scalloped hammerhead sharks to Mikomoto Island.
It is now part of my yearly routine to go there and meet my friends old and new, Masayuki Agawa explained. The perturbation of the Kuroshio is now at a record duration, and nobody knows when it will end. It is not a positive change for everyone, but I cannot help hoping it lasts for much longer.

Unsung, Winner, Macro Category, Canada, Vancouver Island
Photo: Shane Gross, Canada - UPY 2023
A shoal of embryonic fish still attached both to the seabed and their egg sacs reveals another incredible insight into life in the sea.
Walking along a rocky shoreline we would peer under rocks using a probe lens and my camera's LCD screen to check for plainfin midshipman nests, said Shane Gross. Once found, I would lay on top of the barnacle-covered rocks, cutting my elbows, trying to compose images of fish most people have never heard of despite having one of the most interesting lifecycles of any animal.
Plainfin midshipman are deep-water fish that travel to the intertidal zone to spawn. The males sing to attract females that will lay as many eggs as his singing deserves before moving on to the next singer. Each male has a chance to fertilize the eggs, but only if hes not beaten to the punch by a sneaky male that resembles a female. The singer male will then guard the nest never knowing that the kids may not be his.
Relentless Gaze, third place, Macro Category, Bimini, Bahamas
Photo: Kat Zhou, U.S. - UPY 2023
This photo depicts a close-up look at the eye of a nurse shark, taken on a night dive off the coast of Bimini in the Bahamas.
Though this night dive was completely unbaited, one particular nurse shark, named Relentles for her unwavering presence on dives in the area, followed us around on the entire time, perching herself on the sand next to us every time we stopped and swimming after us when we moved, said Kat Zhou. Since she was so calm around us, I was able to take a few close-up shots of her eye.
Pinkaboo, commended, Macro category, South Pacific.

A tiny golden damselfish glistens against the beautiful background of red sea whips creating a beautiful frame celebrating this expansive coral that provides a home to juvenile golden damsels.
Hard at Work Behind the Scenes, highly commended, Macro category, Maldives
Photo: David Alpert, UK - UPY 2023
The strong currents of the Maldives momentarily raised the giant carpet anemone away from the reef, to which it was attached, to exposed the most beautiful and delicate spotted porcelain crab on its underside.
As new ocean water flowed into the space, the crab would raise its feathery arms like structures located right below the head to filter planktonic algae and crustaceans out of the water.
Behavior category
Make Love Not War, winner, Behavior Category, Indonesia Tulamben, Bali
Photo: Yury Ivanov, Indonesia - UPY 2023
A couple of coconut octopuses mating. I knew that I can find this species of octopus at one of the dive sites near Tulamben village in Bali, Indonesia, and that they are active only at night time in that place.
After more than 30 night dives I finally got lucky, said Yury Ivanov. The photo shows the end of their mating.
Chew With Your Mouth Closed!, third place, Behavior Category, United States, St. John's River Spring
Photo: Bryant Turffs, U.S. - UPY 2023
A common snapping turtle feeds in a freshwater spring.
I intended to make images of manatees, but my attention was captured by this charismatic turtle who seemed comfortable with my presence and went about her business foraging, recalled Bryant Turffs.
These turtles will consume vegetation, live prey and also serve as scavengers in aquatic ecosystems. In this image, the turtle is consuming a scavenged flatfish, commonly known as hog-choker. The fish species got its name from farmers who observed pigs choking on their spines but not the turtle.
Organised chaos, commended, Behavior category, Marsa Nakari, Red Sea
Photo: Paul Pettitt, UK - UPY 2023
This image of feeding mackerel was taken at Marsa Nakari, Red Sea, in late November.
The optimum time to take this sort of picture in my experience is about 9am, when the fish seem to be feeding and corralling tighter, explained Paul Pettitt.
In Motion And Compact
Klunzinger's Wrasse In Motion, winner, Compact category, Egypt, Marsa Alam
Photo: Enrico Somogyi, Germany - UPY 2023
When I was snorkeling in Marsa Alam, I saw countless Klunzinger's Wrasses, said Enrico Somogyi. One of them was particularly curious and very interested in my lens.

This stunning photo of a lionfish swimming peacefully while searching for food above the corals was taken just before sunset on Christmas Day in the lagoon of Reunion Island.
British Waters Wide and Macro Angles
An Island's Wild Seas, winner, British Waters Wide Angle category, Needles Marine Conservation Zone, ... [+] Isle of Wight
Photo: Theo Vickers, UK - UPY 2023
Sunlight beats down through a marine jungle of Himanthalia algae and the purple-tipped tentacles of snakelocks anemones rising up from the forest floor on the chalk reefs of Englands Needles Marine Conservation Zone.
Striking rock formations, the Needles on the Isle of Wight, attract close to 500,000 visitors annually. Yet, like many of Britains marine habitats, the beauty and biodiversity of the islands chalk reefs that lie below, from nudibranchs and rays to cuttlefish and cuckoo wrasse, are largely unknown to most.
River dance', highly commended: British Waters Wide Angle category
Photo: Jenny Stock, UK - UPY 2023
The hidden world of our familiar chalk streams is fascinating, said Jenny Stock. This picture was taken on my first day of shooting grayling and my patience paid off when these characterful swans joined the party.
Egg Eaters, winner, British Waters Macro category, Scotland, Shetland

Photo: MNimmo, UK - UPY 2023
A sea urchins shell continues to serve an important ecological service even after the original occupying urchin has long gone. The inside of the shell provides a surface on which small fish species (such as gobies) may spawn as the inner space of the shell may act as a sanctuary or refuge against potential predators.
The urchin shell in this image was found in the upper reaches of Loch Duich, Scotland, and the small butterfish taking refuge inside came to peer out tentatively.
Marine Conservation
Hopeless', winner, Marine Conservation category, Mexico, Baja California
Photo: Alvaro Herrero, Spain - UPY 2023
A humpback whale dies a slow, painful and agonizing death after having its tail entangled in a ropes and buoys, rendering it completely useless.
Taking this photograph was, for me, the saddest moment I've experienced in the ocean, particularly because I have spent so much time interacting with humpbacks underwater and realizing that they are sentient and intelligent creatures, said Alvaro Herrera. But I'm glad I was able to capture that moment and show the world what is happening and drive us to make real changes.
Unfortunate Piercing, Third Place, Marine Conservation category, Boomer Beach, La Jolla, California
Photo: Celia Kujala, U.S - UPY 2023
Celia Kujala too this heartbreaking image of a beautiful California sea lion in La Jolla that had a lure hooked in her mouth.
California sea lions travel long distances to hunt for food and may come in contact with fishing boats while offshore, she explained. However, I have also seen people fishing by the sea lion colony so it is possible that she became hooked in her own home. I will never forget the terror in the eyes of sea lions that have had a hook get embedded on a flipper or other part of their body. Unfortunately, this sea lion went into the water before the rescue team was able to help her.
Save Our Seas
Supremacy, highly commended, Save our Seas Foundation Marine Conservation category
Photo: David Serradell , Spain - UPY 2023
An emotional picture shows these magnificent ocean animals dead and bloodied, and the complexity of social factors behind most conservation issues.
I took this image while on a surftrip on the east coast of Sri Lanka, said David Serradell. A series of sharks laying dead on the ground with marks on their mouths from hooks, most likely from longlines set miles away offshore.
The fisherman in the doorway will get little money from his most recent catch compared with how much the reselling of the dried fins from these sharks will attract in Asian markets.
I cannot blame the fishermen, Serradell explained. This is the only thing they have been doing for their entire lives, with the only goal of bringing food to the family table. But in approximately 50 years, humans have brought sharks to the brink of extinction, a group that has survived five mass extinctions.
Baby Paradorn, commended, Save our Seas Foundation Marine Conservation category
Photo: Sirachai Arunrugstichai, Thailand - UPY 2023
Paradorn, an orphaned Irrawaddy dolphin calf, nibbles on a baby bottle while resting in the arms of its caretaker at the rehabilitation facility of Marine Endangered Species Veterinary Hospital, Rayong, Thailand.
The six-month-old dolphin was rescued from stranding in the eastern Gulf of Thailand on July 22, 2022, and then taken into care by the veterinarians of the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources. The chances for an unweaned calf to survive in the wild without its mother are slim at best.
Sadly, Paradorn died a month later despite the efforts to keep it alive. The Irrawaddy dolphin specie is threatened throughout its distribution range in coastal, estuarine, and riverine habitats of Southeast Asia and is also listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.

Travel has certainly resurged since pandemic-related restrictions were lifted ... but it is different from before.
Travelers faced new frustrations, whether it was higher prices, longer wait times or more crowds. Destinations eager to welcome back waves of visitors were confronted with obstacles like unprepared infrastructure, the impact of inflation on local populations and unforeseen environmental calamities. Hotels and airlines continued to struggle with staffing shortages, operational challenges and supply chain issues.
And yet, despite those hurdles, the desire to travel has never shone brighter. Intrepid adventurers journeyed to new (to them) corners of the globe in search of unique experiences. Folks who had perhaps put off a trip or two found reasons to take them. And all of us discovered the joy of reconnecting with loved ones near and far.
As we look ahead to next year, we are excited to share our list of the best places to go in 2024, drawing from our own editorial team's expertise and also that of our outstanding group of contributors from around the world.

Best for experiencing once-in-a-lifetime events on the world stage
Whether it's high fashion or haute cuisine, France is known for creating creme-de-la-creme experiences. But the sheer number of special events and exciting new developments expected to take place there in 2024 will have even the French exclaiming, ""Sacré bleu!""
The marquee happening, of course, will be the 2024 Summer Olympics from July 26-Aug. 11. The opening ceremony will take place along the Seine in the heart of Paris, but showstopping venues will include the magnificent grounds of Versailles for the equestrian events, various stadiums throughout the country, and even French Polynesia for the surfing competition. The stage is set for a truly spectacular set of games.
The Olympics have even displaced the Tour de France from its normal final stage along the Champs-Elysees in Paris. The alternate is, thankfully, a sun-splashed finish line along the Cote d'Azur in Nice. That's within easy driving distance of the relatively new Carlton Cannes, a luxurious reimagining of one of France's most iconic hotels courtesy of IHG. Hilton is also planning a vast French expansion with various branded properties in cities including Cannes, Dijon, Bordeaux and Marseille.
On a more somber note, June 6 will mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, and the region is planning over 100 special events to commemorate this historic event, including a June 1 sound-and-light show using 2,500 drones over the five landing beaches. From March 22-Sept. 22, the region will also host the Normandy Impressionist Festival, celebrating the 150th anniversary of the first Impressionist exhibition. Events will include a major show of James Abbott McNeill Whistler at Rouen's Fine Arts Museum, while the Musee d'Orsay in Paris will host the ""Paris 1874: The Impressionist Moment"" showcase of 130 masterpieces of painting, sculpture, photographs and more.
In the east, Strasbourg will be UNESCO's 2024 World Book Capital, with events organized around various themes like poetry, refuge, debate and more. The Alsatian capital is also home to one of Europe's most charming Christmas markets in the month leading up to the holiday, which is well worth a visit.
Wine lovers should head to Bordeaux for its famous Fete le Vin from June 27-30 to enjoy the region's famous vintages and gourmet delicacies, along with live music and other performances. They can even put their Accor points to use with a stay at a new Philippe Starck-designed, 97-room Mondrian constructed around a historic 19th-century building right in the city center, complete with an expansive open-air terrace. Now that's something worth toasting to.
TPG tip: Hotel reservations around the Olympics can be notoriously hard to confirm and Paris is cracking down on short-term rentals, so if you plan to attend the Games, prepare to pay high prices for an official package ... or take your chances trying to book something at the last minute.

San Diego, California &amp; Tijuana, Mexico
GETTY IMAGES/THE POINTS GUY
Best for art and design lovers who appreciate cross-cultural collaborations
In a first, two neighboring cities in two different countries have been designated the World Design Capital for 2024: San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Mexico. The World Design Organization accolade recognizes cities that effectively utilize design to enhance their residents' economic, social, cultural and environmental quality of life. San Diego and Tijuana will celebrate the designation through unique experiences, from events and festivals to exhibitions and summits.
Community events scheduled throughout 2024 include Tijuana's World Design Street Festival (April 28), where travelers can attend concerts, public design workshops, exhibitions and design studio open houses. The Mingei International Museum in San Diego and the Centro Cultural Tijuana will simultaneously host an exhibition called ""Frontera,"" focused on jewelry design. In September, both cities will host an interactive World Design Experience.
Aside from its WDO duties, San Diego has a lot going on. One of the West Coast's largest adaptive reuse projects, the 10-acre, sustainably designed Horton Campus, set for completion at the end of 2023, has transformed a former downtown shopping mall into a chic development with white-and-glass structures, parks, shops and lab space, each with either a green roof or solar panels.
San Diego's white-hot culinary scene continues to heat up, with Valle winning San Diego's first Michelin star earlier this year. Restaurant openings to look forward to in 2024 include all-day cafe Wildflour from award-winning chef Phillip Esteban, the farm-and-vine-to-table Cellar Hand, and chef Brian Malarkey's highly anticipated French-inspired steakhouse, Le Coq, in the tony coastal enclave of La Jolla.
San Diego's hotel roster is also growing. The new owners of the historic Lafayette Hotel in North Park, which had fallen into disrepair, unveiled a stylish $31 million renovation this summer, and the bucolic Inn at Rancho Santa Fe will celebrate its 100th anniversary following the completion of multimillion-dollar renovations in 2024. The iconic Hotel del Coronado is in the throes of a wholesale revamp. The Beach Village at The Del will unveil a full makeover at the end of 2023, while its Victorian section will be renovated in 2025. A new 39-room boutique hotel in Coronado called The Bower is also slated to debut in fall 2024.
Tijuana got its own new hotel in 2023: Hotel Brecha, a boutique hotel with art-filled walls and nine sleek rooms. Recent bar and restaurant openings across the city's diverse culinary scene include the speakeasy-style Border Saloon and seafood spots Don Vergas Mariscos Tijuana and Don Timon.
TPG tip: Tijuana, which has been sorely lacking in green space, will have a new eco-park by the end of 2023, Parque Esperanto. The 320-acre plot will involve the reforestation of 15,000 trees and feature amenities like an open-air gym, sports fields, zip lines, children's play areas and a bicycle path.

Best for lovers of tea and tigers keen to explore one of India's hidden corners
Home to a fascinating blend of Indigenous tribes, awe-inspiring landscapes, traditional mountain villages and UNESCO-inscribed national parks, the eastern Indian region of Assam has cultural and natural wonders just waiting for travelers to explore without the crowds you might find in better-known South Asian destinations.
The region's main artery, the mighty 1,800-mile-long Brahmaputra River, runs from the Himalayan highlands of Tibet to Assam's wildlife-rich floodplains, bordered by lush, terraced tea plantations, ornate temples and riverside villages.
Even with just a week or 10 days for your journey, you can learn about tea cultivation in Jorhat (Assam produces over 50% of India's famed tea), marvel at imposing Ahom temples in bustling Sivasagar the sacred former capital of Assam's Ahom kings and learn about the socially inclusive religion of neo-Vaishnavism on Majuli, one of the world's largest river islands and a haven for birdlife.
Straddling the border with Bhutan, UNESCO-listed Manas National Park is a biodiversity hot spot known for its sightings of buffaloes and rhinoceroses that graze in forests that surround the Manas River. The highlight of any visit, though, is a Jeep safari to the UNESCO World Heritage site of Kaziranga, which provides sanctuary to endangered one-horned rhinoceroses, Asian elephants, Bengal tigers, panthers, bears, gaurs (Indian bison) and myriad other species.
Next year, several new cruise itineraries will make the region more accessible to travelers keen to get off the beaten path without sacrificing creature comforts. Banyan Tours will operate four-, seven- and 10-night Assam cruises from Kolkata aboard the luxurious ABN Charaidew II and the more intimate 12-cabin ABN Sukhapa. Both ships feature spacious, beautifully appointed cabins, large sun decks, small spas, a library, gourmet cuisine and onboard naturalists. Guests can spend time in between excursions scouring the waters for species such as the endangered Ganges river dolphin and the smooth-coated otter.
TPG tip: For travelers looking for rare tiger and mammal encounters across several Indian regions, in January, andBeyond will offer a 16-day limited-edition Project Tiger Expedition that will celebrate the 50th anniversary of India's renowned tiger conservation initiative. The itinerary begins in Delhi before visiting three of India's most iconic national parks: Kanha, Kaziranga and Ranthambhore.

Best for an affordable Mediterranean beach getaway
Turquoise Mediterranean waters lapping beautiful beaches? Check. Picturesque hilltop villages? Check. Forest-covered mountains and mouthwatering food and wine? Check and check. Albania has all the attributes of more popular Southeastern Europe destinations like the Greek islands but without the crowds and the high price tag.
Begin your adventure in Tirana, the capital city, where Brutalist architecture blends with charming, tree-filled neighborhoods. Take a cable car ride up Mount Dajti for panoramic views of the city and stay at the sophisticated Tirana Marriott, though IHG loyalists might want to hold out for the opening of the InterContinental in 2025.
Just an hour southwest from Tirana International Airport (TIA), check in to the newly opened Melia Durres Albania, a luxurious beachfront retreat in a dreamy beach town offering stunning Adriatic Sea views and an opportunity to unwind.
Heading south along the coast, enjoy picturesque beaches while exploring charming towns like Dhermi and Jale, and savor the local cuisine, renowned for its fresh seafood and Mediterranean spices.
Then, immerse yourself in the country's vibrant summer music scene. The weeklong Kala Festival in early June features house, disco, soul and funk music across five intimate stages along the pristine shores of the Ionian Sea.
Back in the hinterlands, you can delight in mouthwatering delicacies at the AgriTourism Huqi farm located a short drive from the capital, like slow-cooked lamb (mish ne pus), and sample a variety of flavorful cow and goat cheeses. Don't forget to try local wines like the tangy white ceruja and full-bodied red kallmet at the family-run Nurellari Winery, less than a half-hour from the 13th-century fort city of Berat.
For an even deeper glimpse of the country's rich heritage and archaeological sites, wander its many ancient settlements, like Butrint, which played host to the Greek, Roman and Byzantine civilizations. Even with all that history, Albania feels exciting and new once again, and you won't have it to yourself for much longer.
TPG tip: Fly into a major European gateway like Frankfurt or Paris and then connect to Tirana via air. From there, book a one-way car rental to the port city of Sarande so that when your time in Albania is over, you can catch a 30-minute ferry to Corfu, Greece, where you have even more history and beaches to explore, and many low-cost flight options to major European airports.

Best for epic wildlife and sustainable travel
One of the most biodiverse places on Earth, framed by rugged Pacific and Caribbean coastlines and home to magical cloud forests, picture-perfect volcanoes and extraordinary marine reserves, Costa Rica has long captivated wild-at-heart travelers.
An eco-tourism pioneer in the 1990s, and dubbed the ""Switzerland of South America"" due to its mountainous green landscapes and political stability in a sometimes volatile region, Costa Rica continues to raise the bar with its commitment to environmental protections; over 25% of its land is national parks and reserves.
For travelers looking to combine sustainable outdoor adventures with sumptuous accommodations, 2024 is when it all comes together. A flurry of exciting new hotels are set to debut, including Nekajui, just the sixth of Marriott's ultraexclusive Ritz-Carlton Reserves. Designed with a light environmental footprint on a pristine swath of the Papagayo Peninsula, the 107-key resort takes inspiration from a traditional stone Costa Rican hacienda surrounded by treehouse-style buildings tucked discreetly into steep hillsides.
Nearby, the luxurious Waldorf Astoria Residences Guanacaste will be the brand's first Costa Rican outpost, embodying the ""pura vida"" lifestyle with a holistic wellness center and cenote-inspired spa. Elsewhere, the Four Seasons Resort Peninsula Papagayo comes back online following a multimillion-dollar renovation with a new beach club and expanded wellness offerings.
For travelers looking for a low-key retreat with easy airport access, as well as proximity to San Jose's cultural attractions, the new Hyatt Centric in Escazu another brand first for Costa Rica will offer World of Hyatt loyalists an ideal bookend to a Costa Rica road trip.
The wildlife-rich Osa Peninsula is more accessible (and especially alluring to points enthusiasts) these days thanks to the recent opening of Botanika, part of Hilton's Curio Collection. The eco-chic property places travelers within striking distance of Corcovado National Park, one of the best places on the planet to view sloths, toucans, giant anteaters, howler monkeys and ocelots.
Visit the region from August through December to witness one of the world's greatest natural attractions: humpback whales migrating to Golfo Dulce, one of just four tropical fjords on the planet. The habitat, critical for the survival of the whale species, was awarded Whale Heritage Site status in 2023, one of only eight such sites worldwide.
TPG tip: U.S. airlines are adding new flights to Costa Rica, including Delta Air Lines, which will boost its service from Atlanta with three additional flights per week to both San Jose and Liberia (for Papagayo) from Jan. 13. Flights on the Liberia route are currently available this winter starting at 26,000 Delta SkyMiles or $421 round-trip.

South Korea
GETTY IMAGES/THE POINTS GUY
Best for glimpsing the future while exploring the past
The ""Korean Wave"" a tide of global popularity the country's cultural economy has created thanks to K-pop music, K-dramas on television and movies has swept the world in recent years. In fact, youth tour company Contiki has announced the first K-Wave trip to South Korea to showcase local pop culture.
However, South Korea's entertainment culture is just one of a long list of reasons this Asian sensation should be on your 2024 travel list.
Four distinct seasons provide stunning backdrops year-round, so there's no wrong time to visit. Spring brings the magic of Jinhae's cotton candy-pink cherry blossoms while crimson and cadmium foliage frames the historic temples of Naejangsa and Taeansa during fall.
The past and the future intersect in the capital, Seoul, where heritage sites like the 14th-century Jongmyo Shrine coexist with futuristic architecture, including the Zaha Hadid-designed Dongdaemun Design Plaza and the striking Seoul City Hall, with its seven-story vertical garden and prismatic glass facade.
Set to open in late 2024, the Seoul Robot and Artificial Intelligence Museum will showcase science and technology through interactive exhibits featuring AI and virtual reality. Robots aided in the museum's construction and will participate in its day-to-day operations, including welcoming guests and leading tours.
New spaces and exhibitions await visitors at the Busan Museum of Art, which showcases modern Korean artwork. Renovations begin in 2024 and will add high-tech features like evolving 3D projections.
A luxury clifftop island retreat overlooking the East China Sea, the stunning JW Marriott Jeju Resort &amp; Spa, designed by Bill Bensley, debuted in 2023. And though it will be a while, in 2025, the luxury chain Capella Hotels and Resorts is set to open its first Korean property, Capella Yang Yang, near Songjeong Beach in Yangyang, Gangwon Province, where travelers can explore the region's famous pine forests and enjoy its ultrafresh seafood.
TPG tip: Travelers eager to explore South Korea's assorted allures can take advantage of increased airlift from the U.S. United Airlines has upped its frequencies between Incheon International Airport (ICN) and San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to 12 flights weekly. By the end of 2023, Air Premia will add flights between Seoul and Honolulu, too.

Best for travelers who want to see a rare total solar eclipse in their own backyard
On April 8, some 31.5 million Americans will be able to witness a total solar eclipse from their doorstep when the moon passes between the sun and the earth, completely blocking the sun's face. The heavenly event will cut its way across North America, passing through Texas, the Midwest and some Eastern states. It's a sight you won't want to miss the next total solar eclipse won't be visible from the contiguous United States for another 20 years.
Parts of San Antonio will experience about two minutes of midday darkness, making it the largest U.S. city along the path of totality. The 15-mile-long San Antonio River Walk is just south of the path, so visitors there will only see a 99% partial eclipse. Nevertheless, many hotels and restaurants are hosting viewing events, including a Solar Brunch at The Moon's Daughters, where guests and locals can see the eclipse unfold from the indoor-outdoor perch on the 20th floor.
An hour northwest of San Antonio, the town of Kerrville, Texas, one of NASA's Primary Eclipse Partners, will have over four minutes of darkness. The Texas Hill Country community's Schreiner University will host a weekendlong festival with celestial yoga, trail walks and observatory tours.
With renowned institutions known for cutting-edge research in space science and technology and expecting four minutes of totality Dallas will be one of the best eclipse destinations. At the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, 20 astronomers will answer questions. The city's many hotels, meanwhile, plan to offer stylish viewing, like Virgin Hotels Dallas, which will host a lively rooftop pool party.
This will be Indianapolis' first total solar eclipse in more than 800 years, and the town is going all-out with a citywide party to celebrate its 3 1/2 minutes of totality, including events at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (NASA will broadcast live from the venue) and the Indianapolis Zoo.
In Cleveland, another NASA partner city, a natural phenomenon known as a lake effect (where cool air blows away clouds from the shoreline of Lake Erie) will allow visitors to view the eclipse for nearly four minutes. Downtown, The Ritz-Carlton, Cleveland is offering a solar eclipse package with club-level accommodations for two and celestial-themed cocktails. The Great Lakes Science Center and NASA's Glenn Research Center are hosting Total Eclipse Fest from April 6-8, with science activities for kids and a classical music concert.
Buffalo will experience just under four minutes of totality, with the best vantage points found inside Niagara Falls State Park, while the Sheraton Niagara Falls is offering a two-night package, including eclipse viewing glasses and breakfast.
In Vermont, Stowe Mountain Resort will whisk skiers and snowboarders via gondola to the top of Mount Mansfield, Vermont's highest peak, for high-altitude views during the nearly three minutes of totality the town is set to experience.
TPG tip: Holland America has put together a 22-day Solar Eclipse cruise, where guests will depart from San Diego and experience the eclipse off the coast of Mexico.

Bissagos Islands, Guinea-Bissau

Best for intrepid naturalists seeking an under-the-radar destination
Sandwiched between Guinea and Senegal, Guinea-Bissau is one of West Africa's lesser-visited destinations, but that's what has helped keep the 88-island Bissagos archipelago 31 miles off its coast so untouched.
This astonishingly wildlife-rich island chain often dubbed the Galapagos of Africa is an idyll of empty white-sand beaches, thick mangroves, teeming lagoons and dense palm and cashew forests. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996, the Bijagos (as they're also known) are home to thriving populations of saltwater hippopotamuses, manatees, dolphins, green sea turtles, flamingos, rays, sharks and around 175 fish and 500-plus bird species.
And you won't be vying for sightings with other safari vehicles or Zodiac boats. These paradisiacal islets are home to just 33,000 or so residents who hew to their traditional matriarchal society, and there are no formal resorts or ecolodges.
The archipelago has also been quite difficult to reach. However, a handful of luxury and small-ship cruises have begun to call at the islands. Ponant Cruises has just opened sales for its first dedicated nine-day ""Adventure in the Bissagos Islands"" itinerary (April 7-15, 2025) on Le Lyrial, which starts and ends in Dakar, Senegal. During the journey, guests can expect to spy towering baobabs and flocks of migratory birds, playful vervet monkeys and vividly colored lizards, and take part in ancient ceremonies alongside the Bijago people.
On board MS Spitsbergen, Hurtigruten now offers a 14-day ""West Africa Archipelago"" cruise (paired with Cape Verde), which includes four days of deploying small rigid inflatable boats and sea kayaks to navigate the islands and channels for awe-inspiring wildlife sightings. The line also arranges encounters with the islanders, who have acted as custodians of this wonderfully biodiverse and pristine part of Africa, and who dedicate some 100 days per year to sacred rites and ceremonies such as fanado and difuntu.
Swan Hellenic's Ghana-to-Senegal ""Crucibles of West Africa"" trip, on the new 152-guest SH Vega, has two days scheduled in this off-the-grid sanctuary, where shore excursions include explorations of Orango National Park's mangrove thickets and savannah as well as trekking through traditional villages on Canhabaque.
As with many of the world's island paradises, the clock is likely ticking down on the Bissagos remaining immaculate and undeveloped, so if you hope to see them as they are, 2024 is the year to go.
TPG tip: Non-cruisers can visit the islands by first flying into the capital, Bissau, from Lisbon with TAP Air Portugal. Alternatively, Delta Air Lines has daily direct flights from New York to Dakar, from which there are daily connections on Air Senegal to Bissau. From Bissau, hire a speedboat for the hourlong journey to Bubaque, where the affordable Saldomar guesthouse and Hotel Kasa Afrikana make great home bases for daytrips to islands like Rubane, Orango and Canhabaque.

Best for pristine landscapes and rich Indigenous cultures
Quebec has long attracted travelers with its cosmopolitan towns, distinctly French flair and untouched wilderness. Thanks to a bold commitment to supporting Indigenous tourism, in 2024, the Canadian province will also provide new and meaningful ways to experience its natural beauty, its people and its culture.
Travelers can take in the aurora borealis while learning about Inuit traditions in Quebec's Arctic region of Nunavik, scan for beluga and blue whales with an Innu guide in Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park, or forage for mushrooms and berries in the Laurentian mountain range. Across Quebec, there are now abundant opportunities to delve deeper into the ancestral traditions of the area's First Nations, Innuit and Metis people.
The recent addition of Anticosti Island to Canada's cache of UNESCO-protected heritage sites will draw wilderness seekers to its otherworldly canyons, primordial forests and cascading waterfalls. The island's 1,440 known fossil species offer the most ""complete and best preserved paleontological record of the first mass extinction of animal life, 447-437 million years ago,"" according to UNESCO, providing a unique window into our planet's past.
For urbanites, Quebec City's lamplit, cobblestone streets have never been a hard sell for a weekend getaway, but now there are even more reasons to linger. Join one of Cicerone's locally led walking tours, shop for regional artworks along Rue du Tresor, see Inuit art at the Musee National des Beaux-Arts du Quebec (a new exhibit starts in February) and then dine on inventive boreal cuisine at Indigenous-owned restaurant Sagamite, whose owners have added two boutique hotels to their portfolio and will open a new microbrewery in 2024.
Head just outside the city's 400-year-old walls to Canada's only recognized Huron-Wendat community. Here, the superb First Nations-owned Hotel-Musee Premieres Nations was recently revamped with luxe suites and rooms appointed with Indigenous artworks and textiles with First Nations motifs. The hotel's restaurant, La Traite, helmed by much-lauded chef Marc de Passorio, provides a magical initiation into ancestral flavors with standout dishes like local tomatoes with sage and Quebec buffalo mozzarella and hearty bison medallions with beet puree and thyme juice.
TPG tip: Bookend your trip with a stay in Montreal, where the hotel scene is buzzing. There's the new art deco-inspired Honeyrose Hotel, Montreal, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, where Marriott points will come in handy, and the iconic Vogue Hotel Montreal Downtown, an elegant retreat on Montreal's Golden Square Mile which has been revamped and is now part of Hilton's Curio Collection.

Best for travelers Down Under looking for the right mix of urban and wildlife adventures
Best known for one of Earth's natural wonders, the Great Barrier Reef, there's a lot more to this northeastern Australian state (though a visit to the reef is still top of the list while you still can climate change and other factors are having increasingly adverse effects on much of the aquatic ecosystem).
In the capital, Brisbane, once-gritty environs like Howard Smith Wharves have been revitalized with trendy bars and restaurants. However, one of the biggest redevelopments is still on the horizon. The $2.6 billion Queen's Wharf precinct is nearing completion on 30 acres of prime riverfront land with not one but three hotels planned, plus over 50 dining and drinking venues, a huge footprint for retail and tons of outdoor spaces like a 100-meter-high sky deck with 360-degree views. In October, the city will also host the first annual Melt Open festival celebrating queer art and culture.
Down south in the blingy surfer haven of Gold Coast, travelers will be able to check in to a sleek new twin-towered Mondrian hotel and residences, while north along the Sunshine Coast, the tourism industry is taking the lead in regenerating bush once used for cattle grazing with native subtropical rainforest, which visitors can enjoy by staying at the avant-garde new Kurui Cabin at the base of the Cooroy Mountains.
In an effort to cultivate Indigenous-owned and -operated tourism businesses, the state has already invested 7 million Australian dollars in the Growing Indigenous Tourism in Queensland Fund. What's more, UNESCO World Heritage-listed Fraser Island the world's largest sand island and a habitat for diverse wildlife where you can also swim with migrating humpback whales has officially reverted to its traditional Butchulla name, K'gari.
Speaking of islands, luxury travelers can have an entire one to themselves along the Great Barrier Reef thanks to the November opening of Pelorus Private Island in the Great Palm archipelago off the Townsville coast. The nearly 1,000-acre paradise has just a single four-suite residence designed in a traditional, breezy Queenslander style, where guests can customize their entire experience from days out yachting between islands or exploring the island's teeming fringe reefs to enjoying leisurely meals prepared by a private chef.
TPG tip: It's getting even easier to travel from the U.S. directly to Queensland since United increased its frequencies between San Francisco and Brisbane from three times per week to daily in October and will launch three weekly nonstops between Los Angeles and Brisbane in December.

Train travel

Best for high-velocity thrills or romantics looking to slow things down
Trains revolutionized travel in the 19th century, but 2024 might just be a rail renaissance thanks to new, thrilling high-speed routes, plush overnight sleepers and lavish itineraries on par with the world's best hotels.
Global developments in high-speed rail are coming to a pitch, with various highly anticipated routes finally entering operation. In Florida, the long-awaited Brightline has opened up an efficient new corridor between two major U.S. cities that are favorites with tourists. The service, which tops out at 125 miles per hour, connects Orlando International Airport (MCO) and Miami in just three hours (with 15 daily departures) and also courses between Miami and West Palm Beach via Aventura and Fort Lauderdale.
In Europe from late 2024, the ultraquiet Frecciarossa train will zip from Paris to Barcelona in just seven hours, shaving two hours from current travel times. In time for the Summer Olympics, Spanish rail company Renfe also plans to extend its daily Madrid-Marseille service through to Paris.
If you're craving tropical surroundings, Belmond's Eastern &amp; Oriental Express returns to Southeast Asia in February after a pandemic hiatus. The restyled trains feature eight sleeper cars, two restaurant cars, a piano bar and an open-air observation car. The three-night ""Essence of Malaysia"" itinerary will operate from November to February from Singapore to Penang, with stops in Kuala Lumpur and the island of Langkawi (via private boat). Operating from March to May and August to October, the ""Wild Malaysia"" experience steams from Singapore along the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, with stops to spot wildlife at Taman Negara National Park and Penang before returning to Singapore.
Later in 2024, Orient Express will debut its opulent La Dolce Vita trains with lavish art deco cabins, haute cuisine and world-class bartending. The eight itineraries span one to two nights and include a Sicilian service starting and ending in Palermo via Agrigento and Taormina with a whiz-by of Mount Etna. Other standout itineraries include from Rome to Sicily (via a ferry) and a romantic circular route from Rome to Venice with a stop at Siena.
Finally, Europe continues its relative boom in new sleeper train services. Leading the way is Nightjet, which already connects major cities like Paris, Amsterdam and Zurich. In 2024, the Austrian train operator will expand its Belgian routes from Brussels to Dresden and Prague. Additionally, Deutsche Bahn and SNCF will introduce a high-speed seven-hour service between Paris and Berlin, including stops in Strasbourg on the night route.
TPG tip: Use a Eurail pass (from $208) to explore multiple European countries using rail operators like Deutsche Bahn, SNCF and Trenitalia. Note that high-speed or sleeper options like Nightjet and Eurostar have extra reservation fees (typically $10-$20), but it's still much cheaper than buying individual tickets.

Best for beach and nature lovers who want to avoid crowds
Many travelers make the trek to South Africa for its spectacular wildlife and vibrant cities, but few hop across the border to Mozambique. Though the country has experienced ongoing conflicts in the far north, the central and southern parts remain relatively insulated from internal struggles.
Getting there is easier than you might think, too Airlink offers direct flights to Vilankulos along the coast from Johannesburg, and more recently, the airline launched a nonstop flight between Cape Town and the capital, Maputo. While some travelers tend to skip the city, if you do make use of that route, consider a layover for a night or two. Maputo is a hub of activity with oceanside restaurants serving ultrafresh seafood with icy 2M beers and bakeries proffering crispy, creamy pasteis de nata, a holdover from Portuguese rule. The city's music scene is also buzzing, with bars and clubs playing everything from reggaeton to marrabenta (a hybrid of Mozambican dance with Portuguese folk music).
The main reason people come to the country is for the untouched Indian Ocean beaches along its 1,700-mile coast, which are lapped by aquamarine waters that rival the Caribbean. Over the past few years, a cluster of hotels have opened along the coast, including Kisawa, a design-focused property with 11 villas on a 740-acre sanctuary on Benguerra Island in the ecodiverse Bazaruto Archipelago.
Around two hours from Vilankulos on the mainland and set on a peninsula along a sheltered saltwater lagoon, Sussurro is an intimate pared-back lodge whose sandy-hued rooms are filled with artisan-made baskets and wooden furniture. Next year, Banyan Tree is expected to open Banyan Tree Ilha Caldeira, which promises to be an uberluxury spot, on a private island north of Beira.
For safarigoers, Gorongosa, a national park that has been undergoing a two-decade-long rehabilitation, has become a beacon of regeneration and economic activity in an area where tourism was entirely decimated by civil war. This year, Muzimu Lodge, a tent camp, opened on the banks of the Mussicadzi River. Wildlife is not as abundant as in nearby Kruger National Park (though you can expect to see huge packs of wild dogs and teeming herds of antelope), but the biodiversity is some of the richest in the world, with nearly 500 species of birds. Indelible landscapes like chalky limestone gorges dotted with vegetation and inky caves, woodland savannah and giant ""Jurassic Park""-like forests with sausage trees and native Borassus palms will leave you awestruck.
TPG tip: Ensure you allow ample time for your visa application. The process has moved online, which makes it infinitely swifter than previously, but the application time can still take up to a month and costs $160 or more depending on the type you apply for.
Mary Holland
Note from TPG editors: Due to an ongoing terrorist insurgency in the far north of Mozambique, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 2 warning advising travelers to exercise increased caution when traveling in the Cabo Delgado province. The country also recently experienced some unrest following local elections, so be sure to investigate the current situation before booking a trip.
Bolivia
GETTY IMAGES/THE POINTS GUY
Best for food lovers and thrillseekers looking for something out of this world
Arriving in Bolivia can feel like you've landed on the moon. Have you seen the magnificent Salar de Uyuni? It's a vast salt pan with 3,900 square miles of desertlike cracked earth punctuated by cactus-covered rock piles. Though this parched corner of the earth draws visitors from around the globe, high-end accommodations have been lacking, but that's been changing quickly. In 2022, the Chilean hospitality brand Explora unveiled an intimate six-room mountain lodge set in a slick, glass-fronted building with snug, wood-lined rooms overlooking the flats.
Guests can partake in excursions, but the property also forms part of a greater six-night odyssey: a nomadic expedition where guests journey from Chile's Atacama Desert to Salar de Uyuni, stopping off at Explora's other ""Mountain Lodges"" along the way. Loads of thrilling activities are on offer, such as biking explorations across the Salar, through quinoa fields and beyond, as well as hikes across the largest islands and up into a village to see ancient Andean burial sites.
Whether you decide to begin your journey in the Atacama or Uyuni, don't miss Bolivia's capital La Paz, which sits in a bowl at a (literally) dizzyingly high elevation of 11,975 feet. The city's restaurant scene is arguably one of the most exciting in South America. Make a reservation at Gustu and enjoy a multicourse extravaganza of local delights including alligator and creamy aged corn. Hailed as one of Latin America's best restaurants, it was founded by Noma's Claus Meyer and is now helmed by chef Marsia Taha Mohamed. Also snag a table at Ancestral, where chef Mauricio Lopez (former head chef of Gustu) roasts vegetables and osso buco over an open flame, served alongside Bolivian wines.
The same team that opened the design-driven Atix Hotel (long a favorite among international visitors) unveiled the new Met Hotel last year in a soaring charcoal building with traditional Bolivian arts and crafts highlighted throughout its interior spaces. If you're traveling after July 2024, be sure to check out Altu Qala, a hotel set in a restored neoclassical building with wood-paneled walls and handmade cabinets in upcycled wood. The owner is also behind The Writer's Coffee, a cafe serving artisanal brews in the city, perfect for combating altitude fatigue.
Finally, for the best views of La Paz, take a trip on Mi Teleferico, the cable car transit system that's been expanding its network with various routes and now has 30 stations and 10 lines. Climb into the plastic bubbles, filled with locals whizzing across the city, and head up to El Alto, which sits at a staggering 13,325 feet.
TPG tip: If you really want to soak up the food and wine scene in La Paz, add in an extra few days to acclimatize. It's the highest capital in the world (11,975 feet) and altitude sickness is a high probability, so whizzing in and out is not recommended.

Bali, Indonesia
GETTY IMAGES/THE POINTS GUY
Best for sustainability searchers who also crave cultural connection
Bali is an island of contradictions. It's home to a majority Hindu population but part of predominantly Muslim Indonesia. Visitors in the millions come both to sunbathe and party on its beaches while also seeking spiritual awakenings through wellness retreats. After decades of overtourism, Bali is also pioneering responsible, lower-impact ways for visitors to enjoy its natural wonders and renowned hospitality.
In 2024, the government will levy a $10-per-person fee on international tourists that will directly fund cultural and environmental protection, such as waste management. It's an incremental but important step toward becoming a more sustainable destination.
Luxury resorts are also leaning into the trend. Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay recently debuted Telu, a bar constructed entirely of upcycled materials that serves cocktails made with sustainable ingredients. In early 2024, Ayana Estate will open Museum Saka, a breathtaking 50,000-square-foot gallery showcasing the work of Balinese artists, historians and scholars, all of which is meant to bestow guests with a deeper understanding of the community's vibrant heritage.
At Buahan, a Banyan Tree Escape, about an hour from Ubud, chef Eka Sunarya began experimenting with hypercreative and ultralocally sourced menus. He has since decamped to nearby Mandapa, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, where he continues to highlight seasonal Balinese cuisine with a no-waste philosophy.
Seminyak's Desa Potato Head with its beach club and pair of striking, sustainably designed hotels that all together send just 3% of their waste to landfill continues to be a regenerative tourism pioneer. In 2024, the resort is opening an ambitious Collective Waste Centre that will radically reduce landfill waste from eight nearby resorts, beach clubs and restaurants through high-efficiency sorting, processing and reuse practices.
A slew of exciting all-new hotels beckons design lovers and wellness seekers to Bali, too. Part of Hilton's LXR Resorts &amp; Hotels, Umana Bali is expected to open in November 2023, a brand first in Southeast Asia. Guests will enjoy not only epic vistas from its 72 clifftop pool villas but also next-level cultural programming emphasizing legacy crafts and spa treatments utilizing ancient healing techniques.
Expected to debut in spring 2024, IHG's Regent Canggu will feature 150 suites and villas in one of Bali's hottest beach locales. Architecture by WATG and interior design by HBA will blend contemporary Indonesian fashion and cultural influences with traditional design motifs. Slated for late 2024, Kimpton Naranta Bali will bring boutique vibes to the Nusa Dua resort scene in the reimagined former Amanusa resort, designed by Kerry Hill.
TPG tip: Some of Bali's best points hotels offer deep cultural dives into Balinese village life. At Alila Manggis (from 3,500 World of Hyatt points per night), guests can take part in water purification rituals, visit the Indigenous Bali Aga tribe and trek to the ""Gateway to Heaven"" temple. At The Laguna, part of Marriott's Luxury Collection (from 33,000 Bonvoy points per night), exclusive experiences include lunch with the seventh generation of Kerambitan's royal family.

Cairo, Egypt

Best for ancient treasures in a modern metropolis
Few destinations offer the same look at the mysteries of the past quite like Cairo. While this desert city has long been a magnet for those intrigued by the wonders of ancient Egypt and its former rulers, new attractions and highly anticipated hotel openings will draw even more travelers to this bucket list destination in 2024.
With that in mind, Cairo's most exciting addition will be the long-awaited reopening of the Grand Egyptian Museum, which, after years of delays, is on track to welcome visitors by early 2024. A colossal project that began more than 20 years ago, this massive repository the largest archaeological museum ever built will house over 100,000 Egyptian artifacts, including 5,000 relics found in famous pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb.
Recently discovered artifacts from the Saqqara an expansive necropolis located within Egypt's UNESCO World Heritage-listed ancient capital of Memphis are also expected to be added to the museum's collection in due course. The treasures include multiple tombs, ancient workshops and burial shafts full of priceless antiquities, such as a mummy believed to be the most complete one ever found in Egypt.
To accommodate the influx of tourists expected in 2024, Cairo's hotel scene is rapidly expanding, too. Among the new properties currently in the pipeline are points-friendly accommodations like a Hyatt Centric, a Hilton and a Waldorf Astoria, plus the luxurious rebranding of the historic Shepheard Hotel into the Mandarin Oriental Shepheard, Cairo.
Unsurprisingly, Cairo's prime position on the Nile and proximity to other historic destinations also make it an excellent place to embark on a river cruise, especially in 2024. Several top river cruise lines offer itineraries that start or end in the city, making it possible to tack on visits to other ancient sites like Luxor and Aswan, Egypt. New standout ships to consider include Viking Aton (the fourth of six ships Viking expects to be sailing the Nile by late 2025) and AmaLilia (AmaWaterways' second ship devoted to Nile River cruises).
TPG tip: It should become easier than ever to reach this historic metropolis thanks to more nonstop routes from the U.S. to Cairo in the works. In addition to adding new nonstop flights from Newark to Cairo this past summer, Egyptair has filed a request with the Department of Transportation to launch service between Los Angeles and Cairo in the coming months. If approved, service on the Star Alliance carrier would give visitors yet another convenient way to reach the ancient city.

Best for rediscovering paradise right on our doorstep
Dazzling white- and pink-sand beaches; calm, clear seas shaded in myriad hues of blue; and easy access from various U.S. hubs have long made the Bahamas a top tourist destination. Expect 2024 to be an extra-buzzy year for this Caribbean nation, though, thanks to new hotels, exciting cruises and more flights from major airlines.
Goldwynn Resort &amp; Residences on Nassau's famous Cable Beach was 2023's big hotel debut, offering 81 studios and one-, two- and three-bedroom suites just a short drive from the airport so visitors could be on the beach within an hour of landing. Set to open at the end of 2024, the ultraluxurious Montage Cay will occupy a 48-acre private island in the Abacos. The $352 million project will feature 50 oceanfront suites with private plunge pools and outdoor showers. The property will also comprise villa residences and a 46-slip marina for private yachts.
The Bahamas are drawing even more interest from major cruise lines, too. Norwegian Cruise Line christened its exciting Norwegian Viva megaship with a short cruise to its Bahamian private island, Great Stirrup Cay, in November 2023. The line's second Prima Class vessel, Viva, boasts the ""fastest slides at sea,"" a three-level go-kart racetrack and millions of dollars of art on board. Royal Caribbean's new Oasis Class ship, Utopia of the Seas, is also set to start sailing short new cruises focusing on the Bahamas in 2024.
Cruise lines are adding new private-island experiences, too. Slated to open in summer 2024, Disney's Lighthouse Point in Eleuthera will offer amenities ranging from an adults-only beach to a family water play area and food hall-style dining. The destination is being designed with the environment in mind, too about 90% of its electricity will be provided via solar panels.
TPG tip: Getting from the U.S. to the Bahamas will be easier than ever in 2024, especially from the West Coast. Alaska Airlines is adding seasonal nonstop flights from both Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) four times weekly and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) three times weekly to Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS). The services will run from Dec. 15, 2023, to April 9, 2024. JetBlue is launching its own new flight between Nassau and Los Angeles beginning in November 2023 that will fly once per week on Saturdays. Delta debuted a new nonstop from Miami International Airport (MIA) to Nassau this fall as well.

A mysterious deep-sea shark with protruding teeth and large eyes was caught by a fisherman in Australia in September. At the time, nobody knew what species it was.
Sydney-based fisherman, Trapman Bermagui, posted a photo of the creature to his Facebook page on September 12. At the time he said it had ""the face of a deep sea shark"" that had been caught at a depth of 2,133 feet underwater.
The shark has a distinctive appearance with rough-looking skin, a pointed nose, large eyes, and a protruding set of sharp teeth. Facebook users said the creature looked very prehistoric.
Bermagui told Newsweek he thought it was a rough skin shark, also known as a species of endeavor dog shark.
Mystery of Sheep Walking in Circle in China for 12 Days Potentially Solved
Stock image showing a row of sheep. In November, a flock of sheep was filmed walking in a circle continuously for 12 days. Getty Images
In November, the internet was set ablaze with news of a flock of sheep in China that had been walking in a circle continuously for 12 days. Footage of the sheep on a farm in Inner Mongolia was shared by the state run outlet People's Daily. 
While sheep are known the mimic others in the flock due to instinct, it is very unusual to for them to move in such a synchronized way for such a long time. It was unclear whether individuals had even stopped to drink and eat.
Some experts suggested the weird circle walking was the result of a bacterial disease known as listeriosis, which can cause them to walk in circles.
However, Matt Bell, a professor and director at the Department of Agriculture at Hartpury University, in Gloucester, England, told Newsweek the behaviour may be the result of being kept in a pen for too long.
""This might lead to stereotypic behavior, with the repeated circling due to frustration about being in the pen and limited [as to where they can go],"" he said. ""This is not good. Then the other sheep join as they are flock animals and bond or join their friends.""
Hundreds of Whales Wash Up On Ill-fated Island Surrounded by Sharks
A stock photo shows a stranded pilot whale. Hundreds stranded in a island off New Zealand. Stephen Barnes/Getty
In October, hundreds of whales washed up on the shore of a remote, New Zealand Island surrounded by sharks.
Up to 250 pilot whales could have been involved in the stranding that occurred in the Chatham Islands, on Pitt Island, the stranded whale rescue organization Project Jonah said at the time.
The stranding came shortly after another mass stranding occurred to the northwest of Chatham Island, where 215 pilot whales passed away. The second stranding took the number of stranded whales in the area to 500, all within a few days.
Wildlife officials were sent to the area to initiate rescue efforts, but many whales were euthanized. The remoteness of the location, and the fact many sharks surrounded the island, made rescue efforts dangerous and difficult.
The Chatham Islands are a ""stranding hot spot"" for whales, with nearly half of the whale strandings in New Zealand occur here.
Swarms of Crab-Like Creatures Found in River 1,600ft Beneath Antarctic Ice

Swarms of crab-like creatures were found in a river 1,600 feet beneath the ice in Antarctica in July.
The discovery was a surprise to a team of New Zealand researchers. They were in Antarctica to study a river, hundreds of kilometers from the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, to see how it is impacted by the changing climate.
But as the scientists drilled down into the river with a camera, they unexpectedly discovered swarms of the small amphipods—a creature in the same family as crabs, mites and lobsters.
Professor Craig Stevens, a NIWA Physical Oceanographer taking part in the expedition, said in a press release that it was a ""big surprise.""
""For a while, we thought something was wrong with the camera but when the focus improved, we noticed a swarm of arthropods around 5mm in size,"" he said.

An elephant killed a woman in India and then returned to her funeral and trampled on her lifeless corpse in June.
The 70-year-old woman, Maya Murmu, was attacked by the wild elephant as she walked to collect water in Odisha's Mayurbhanj district, Indian news outlet The Print reported at the time.
After the elephant attacked Murmu, she was rushed to hospital, but she succumbed to her injuries, Lopamudra Nayak, an inspector at the Rasgovindpur police station, told The Print.
But later, as family members gathered for her funeral, the wild tusker appeared once again.
It approached the pyre and grabbed the body, The Print reported. The elephant then trampled on her body again, and threw it away before fleeing.
Whole Alligator Found Inside Burmese Python in Gruesome Footage
A compilation image shows a whole alligator being found inside a Burmese python Instagram/Rosie Moore
A whole alligator was found inside the stomach of Burmese python in Florida in November. The gruesome find was captured in footage posted to Instagram.
The 18-foot Burmese python was caught by field workers in the Everglades national park in Florida. As soon as the field workers spotted the invasive reptile, they euthanized it on site.
But when the reptile was taken for a necropsy, scientists found a whole, 5-foot alligator in its stomach.
A video of the discovery, taken by geoscientist Rosie Moore, showed scientists evaluating the bulge in the python's stomach before opening it up. Scientists can then be seen removing the whole alligator from its stomach.

In May, an incredibly rare jet-black river beast was caught by Texas fishermen. Anglers Justin Jordan and Terrell Maguire were fishing on a marsh in southeast Texas when they came across the beast.
Jordan, who is a fishing guide in the area for Lotus Guide Service, told Newsweek that the creature was a ""very rare"" melanistic alligator gar.
Maguire was the one ""behind the rod"" when they caught it. Jordan estimated it was about five feet long—however the species can reach huge sizes.

An enormous 22-foot python was found to have swallowed a grandmother whole in Indonesia.
The 54-year-old woman called Jahrah had disappeared from her home in the Jambi province of Sumatra's western Island on October 21, the Mail Online reported at the time.
After a search party, local people allegedly found the huge python with a bulging stomach inside a forest. They cut it open and found the woman's whole body inside, the media outlet reported.
""It does appear that there are some genuine cases of reticulated pythons eating humans,"" Graham Alexander, professor of herpetology at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, told Newsweek at the time.
Dolphin Attack on Trainer at Miami Seaquarium Captured in Chilling Footage

The moment a dolphin attacked a trainer at Miami Seaquarium in Florida was captured on film in April.
The incident occurred during the aquarium's Flipper Dolphin Show on April 9.
It was captured on film by photographer Shannon Carpenter—who was at the show with his family at the time. Carpenter later posted it to TikTok.
In the footage, which can be seen here, a trainer in the water suddenly appears to be struggling to stay afloat. It then seems as if she is violently pushed forward. She then attempts to make her way out of the pool, however, she disappears below the water.
When the trainer resurfaces, she makes her way to the dock. After emerging from the pool, she hunches down, visibly frightened. Another trainer can be seen kneeling down and checking on her.
The dolphin then appears from the same spot in the water and swims away. A third trainer continues with the show.",newsweek,Newsweek,South Asian River Dolphin,,,0.1,0.7,"Wildlife, Other",Other,"Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus), Other",English

Representatives from the 14 countries that are home to the worlds populations of river dolphins, came together on October 23 and 24 for the Global Declaration of River Dolphins and their Rivers convening. While there was not unanimous consensus, 11 countries signed a first-of-its-kind global declaration for the protection of river dolphins by 2030. These countries committed to creating transboundary research-driven solutions and recommendations for mitigating threats facing river dolphins and the formation of a global coalition made up of NGOs, scientific research institutions, and foundations to implement the declaration and focus on securing the long-term future of river dolphins, their river habitats, and the communities who depend on those rivers.
National Geographic Explorers Mariana Frias, Fernando Trujillo and Jimena Valderrama were all key participants at the convening heldin Bogotá, Colombia where they joined other experts, ministers and senior officials from South American and Asian countries where river dolphins inhabit. 
Theyve issued the following statements and are available for interviews:
Mariana Frias, National Geographic Explorer and conservation specialistsaid:
We must act now to establish transboundary and global protection orders for aquatic life sustainability. The most effective strategies come from collaborative efforts across communities and countries, with this declaration and coalition we can co-create agreements, policies and practices to generate wide-spread change. 
Fernando Trujillo, National Geographic Explorer and marine biologist andriver dolphin expert with more than 30 years of experience researching the Amazon river dolphins of South America said:
Dolphins are the ambassadors of the Amazon. As they move across bodies of water they demonstrate the importance of freshwater conservation and the impact climate change has on all these river basins. This very same water enriches the environment, the soil and impacts the lives of the millions of people who surround it. Collaborative, global initiatives like the declaration and coalition are necessary to better mitigate the threats dolphins and the riverine communities face.
Jimena Valderrama, National Geographic Explorer and wildlife veterinarian said:
The Unique Mortality Event of over 150 dolphins dying in Lake Tefé was heartbreaking, but also shines a spotlight on the very real impact of climate change on the rivers and riverine communities and should galvanize the conservation efforts of the entire basin.
Frias, Trujillo and Valderrama  are working in South America to better understand the impacts of climate and environmental change in the Amazon and develop solutions to ensure the survival of river dolphins and other aquatic mammals as part of the National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition, a multi-year scientific and storytelling exploration of the Amazon River Basin.

But adventure tourism is big business. The lure of far flung places, of inhospitable environments and of physical and mental challenge is exactly the kind of thing adventure seekers live for.
Kayaking in Antarctica between icebergs the ultimate call of the wild.
getty
The most extreme kind of adventure tourism has recently come under the spotlight with the tragedy of the Titan deep sea submersible loss. There are, however, many other ways to challenge yourself and experience extreme environments with far less risk. Post pandemic, the lure of the wild has become more popular to tourists than ever, and the operators catering to it, more creative in the adventures they curate.
Where then are the most popular inhospitable places in the world that people want to visit? Perhaps unsurprisingly, according to a recent survey conducted by Antarctica Cruises it is the worlds greatest wildernesses and tallest mountains that inspire the most adventurers.
Boundless and beautiful Antarctica may be, but don't expect a warm welcome.
getty
Most popular of all is Antarctica, with visitor numbers expected to be up more than 40% over even the best pre-pandemic years, which translates to more than 100,000 visitors in 2023 alone. The worlds biggest desert stretches for some five and a half million square miles and is the very definition of inhospitable regular 50mph winds, an average temperature of -27°F (-33°C) and at its closest point, more than 600 miles to the nearest city.
But with such hardship comes the promise of great reward. Simply, there is nowhere else on Earth quite like Antarctica. From the seemingly endless and constantly changing expanse of ice and snow, riddled with bottomless glaciers and towering icebergs, luminous blue rivers and hidden frozen lakes, many writers have talked of its power to hypnotize those who visit. Its wildlife too is exceptional vast colonies of penguins, Chinstraps and Gentoos, kings and Emperors. Leopard, Weddell and Crabeater seals and sea elephants, whales of every ilk from Minke to Humpback, Blue to Orca. And thats before we even consider casting an eye skyward to the birdlife.
Tourists look on as a humpback whale raises its fluke before diving deep to feed in Antarctica.

Most visitors to Antarctica spend surprisingly little time actually on land, with cruises by far the most popular way to experience the continent without having to sacrifice life's modern luxuries. Most depart from Ushiaia in Argentina, heading south from Patagonia across the notorious Drake Passage, a two-day voyage famed for its rough seas but not enough to put off thousands of tourists with a keen eye focused on the bottom of the world.
Next most popular is the worlds tallest mountain, Everest. Towering to 29,029 feet (8,848 meters), it has long represented the pinnacle of human endurance with its regular 33 mph winds and average temperature of -16°F (-27°C). Summiting Everest remains a great physical and mental challenge, which is why only around 6,000 people have achieved it.
It may be the roof of the world, but even on route to its summit, Everest is busy.
getty
Reaching Everest Base Camp however, at only 17,600 feet (5,365 meters), is a much more achievable feat that still puts you in the heart of the Himalayan experience. Around 40,000 tourists each year make the spectacular trek from Lukla Airport, winding through awesome mountain scenery, traditional Sherpa villages and high-altitude passes.
Closely following Everest in third spot is another mountain Argentinas Aconcagua, the highest peak outside the Himalaya. At just shy of 22,000 feet (6,960 meters) and with an average temperature of minus -16°F (-27°C), Aconcagua is already inhospitable before you mix in the unbelievable average wind speeds of 63 mph.
Aconcagua Peak is the highest mountain in the Americas and a popular destination for climbers.
getty
Just 68 miles from the nearest city of Mendoza, Aconcagua sees around 3,500 visitors try and reach its peak annually, although those conditions mean only 30-35 percent of them are successful. Make the summit though and youll be rewarded with some of the worlds greatest views reaching out in every direction over the Andes Mountains to Chile, the Pacific Ocean and the sweeping plains of Argentina.
Of the top 10 most inhospitable places ranked by Antarctica Cruises, Argentina has more than any other country with three entries Aconcagua; Cerro Mercedario, the tallest peak in the Cordillera de la Ramada range and eighth highest in the Andes; and Walther Penck, also known as Cerro Tipas, the third highest volcano in the world.
Eight of the top ten places are mountains, which highlights the amazing popularity of hiking and climbing as well as the enduring appeal these vast natural formations hold over people from all walks of life and all corners of the world. For those with the will to brave the elements, embrace the difficulties and overcome the hardships, the rewards of a vacation into the inhospitable places of the world can be life changing.

The post 10 Interesting Ways to (Almost) Die in the Wilderness appeared first on Outside Online.",https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/exploration-survival/wilderness-environmental-medicine-reports-2022/,https://www.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fly-agaric-mushroom_h-1024x576.jpg?width=1200,2022-12-15T14:18:40Z,"""],""renderIntial"":true,""wordCount"":350}'&gt;
 You find a dead body lying in the middle of a field in the wilderness. It has no apparent injuries, and its clothes are undisturbed. What happened?
This may sound like a parlor game, but its a familiar real-life challenge for forensic pathologists. In the latest issue of Wilderness &amp; Environmental Medicine, doctors from Tunisia report three such cases. In each one, they eventually found marks called Lichtenberg figures, a reddish fern-like branching pattern on the surface of the skin that results from a lightning strike. As a result, despite suspicious-looking bruises and abrasions in one of the cases, they were able to rule out foul play.
The catch? These figures generally appear after about an hour, then fade without a trace within 48 hours, so its crucial to identify and photograph them as soon as possible to establish the cause of death. Thats why the Tunisian doctors shared this case series in the journal, in order to raise awareness. And its the same motivation for the wide range of unusual injuries and deaths in remote places that Wilderness &amp; Environmental Medicine reports. How can you be ready to treat the victim of a Sri Lankan sloth bear attack if youve never even heard of it?
In that forewarned-is-forearmed spirit, here are some of the hazards described in the last few issues of the journal. Tread carefully out there.
Crocodiles
From emergency physicians in Puducherry, India, comes the tale of a 50-year-old man bitten on the left leg by a 10-foot crocodile while washing on the riverbank. At the trauma center, doctors stitched up six different lacerations, cleaned and dressed the wounds, and administered antibiotics. But something still didnt look right. An ultrasound revealed that the pressure of the crocodiles jaws had generated enough bruising to completely block the femoral artery and vein, cutting off the legs blood supply.
Based on the Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS), the patient was predicted to lose his leg. But once they realized why blood flow was cut off, they were able to operate and restore circulation, and he made a full recovery. The takeaway: croc bites can look pretty gruesome on the surface, but their blunt force of up to 2,000 pounds can also wreak havoc internally. Check the ultrasound.
Slugs
On a monsoon-soaked afternoon in rural Nepal, police brought a corpse to the local forensic medical facility for autopsy. It was a 47-year-old male of average build and generally good health (other than being dead). Examination revealed a four-inch-long slug lodged in his trachea, facing upward, which had caused him to asphyxiate. Friends explained that the man was in the habit of swallowing slugs to relieve his arthritic joint pain.
The authors of the journal article note that belief in unproven folk remedies continues to thrive in remote locales, in part because of the difficulty of accessing modern medical care. They suggest recruiting more healthcare workers in remote areas, and perhaps offering modern medical training to traditional healers. They also note that eating slugs is a bad idea under any circumstances, citing a 2001 case in Sydney, Australia, where a young man was hospitalized with parasitic meningitis after swallowing two leopard slugs from his garden on a dare.
Mushrooms
Foraging was one of my favorite pandemic hobbies, but one group of potential edibles I steered clear of was mushrooms: its just too hard to know which ones are safe unless youre an expert. Doctors in Atlanta and Turkey report a pair of poisonings from Amanita muscaria, better known as fly agaric, and even better known as the spotted mushrooms in Super Mario Brothers and the Smurfs. Theyre relatively easy to identify, and widely known to be toxic, though boiling and/or soaking is supposed to remove enough toxins to make them safe to eat. Theyre also psychoactive.
The U.S. poisoning involved a 44-year-old who ingested six to ten dried fly agarics that his friend bought from a website called IamShaman.com. He passed out half an hour later, and his heart stopped beating after about ten hours. He was rushed to hospital but never regained consciousness. The Turkish victim, a 75-year-old whod foraged the mushroom for dinner, survived after a long hospital stay. Bottom line: the North American Mycological Association will likely want to update its claim that, in humans, there are no reliably documented cases of death from the toxins in these mushrooms in the past 100 years.
Ramps
Sticking with the foraging theme, three people ended up in hospital somewhere in New York State after eating tacos that included ramps harvested from their backyard. Ramps, sometimes known as wild leeks, are a pungent, garlicky delicacy across eastern North America. Unfortunately, its hard to differentiate them from lookalikes such as lily-of-the-valley and false hellebore. Half an hour after the tacos, all three people noticed a strange sensation in their throats, and two of them began vomiting.
At the hospital, they all tested positive for digoxin, a substance found in foxglove plants that is used as a medication for certain heart conditions but can be dangerous in excess. The story gets confusing from there: subsequent testing of plants from the backyard didnt match up with the symptoms and test results observed in the patients, but its not clear whether they managed to find the same plants that theyd eaten. All the patients ended up being OK (theres an antidote to digoxin overdose), but its another reminder to forage with extreme care.
Cliffs
During an early May expedition on Mount Everest, one of the high-altitude porters unclipped from his fixed rope and wandered away. He had been showing signs of confusion, and he ignored the calls of his expedition mates to come back. From a ridge on Lhotse face, at about 24,000 feet above sea level, he plunged more than 1,300 feet to the bottom of the face. We know how this story ends: in the medical literature, according to the authors of the report, survivable falls seem to max out around 300 feet.
This particular story has a mostly happyand unprecedentedending, though. Climbers from other expeditions rushed to where the porter had landed, and sledded him to an improvised helicopter landing near Camp 2. They called for rescue 15 minutes after he fell; he arrived at Everest Base Camps ER at 45 minutes; at Lukla, the main airport into the Everest region, at 75 minutes; and at a hospital in Kathmandu at 150 minutes. He had a skull fracture and swelling in the brain, but was otherwise in surprisingly good shape. He ended up losing sight in his left eye and having some mild cognitive impairment, but was able to return to physical workthough not to climbing.
Crevasses
On June 4, 2017, a party of climbers was descending from a successful summiting of Denali. Two of the climbers were unroped, and a few hundred meters from camp one of them plunged through a snow bridge into a crevasse. He fell about 65 feet, and got wedged, still vertically upright, between the narrowing ice walls, which were about eight inches apart.
Subsequent attempts to rescue him were pretty crazy: at one point, a ranger who was lowered down to reach him also got wedged so tightly that he couldnt breathe, and the other rescuers on top couldnt hear his cries for help. They tried a chain saw, a blow torch, antifreeze, boiling water, and hacking away at the ice with adzes. After 12.5 hours, a helicopter delivered a pneumatic hammer-chisel. They finally managed to dislodge him 16 hours after he fell. Hed been unresponsive for more than three hours and was presumed dead. But he lived.
The authors of the paper discuss various lessons from this episode, ranging from the obvious (dont climb unroped) to the nuances of how to transition a hypothermia victim from vertical to horizontal without triggering cardiac arrest. The biggest lesson of all: dont give up on rescue efforts, because you never know when someone is going to blow away the odds by surviving way longer than expected.
Bugs in Your Ear
I always thought a bug in your ear was just an idiom, or a story kids tell to scare each other at summer camp. Then, while backpacking through the fjordlands of Newfoundland last summer, a black fly got stuck in my ear for a few hours. The intermittent buzzing from deep within my skull was maddening and a little scary, and attempts to remove it were painful and (my physician wife warned me) dangerous.
Turns out its not that rare, according to a report from ear, nose, and throat specialists in Cincinnati. In fact, Asiatic garden beetles famously crawled into the ears of 186 sleeping campers at a Boy Scouts jamboree in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in July 1957. More generally, about half of bugs removed from ears in hospital emergency departments are cockroaches. When adults have something stuck in their ear, its an insect about 80 percent of the time; for kids, the percentage is lower due to childrens proclivity to intentionally place objects in the external auditory canal.
Dealing with bugs in the ear is more challenging in the backcountry, because you dont usually have specialized equipment with you and theres a significant danger of damaging the delicate structures of the ear. With that in mind, heres the decision tree they provide for bug removal in the wilderness:
(Illustration: Wilderness &amp; Environmental Medicine)
To sum up: start by killing the bug; dont go into your ear unless the bug is still bothering you even after youve killed it, and you can clearly see it. There are several ways to kill it. The most backcountry-friendly is drowning it in vegetable oil or soapy water. Hopefully your first-aid kit has tweezers, because some of the alternativeslike superglue on a cotton swabhave the potential to go seriously wrong.
A Stick in the Eye
Finnish doctors present a comprehensive survey all patients who presented at Helsinki University Eye Hospital over a one-year period in 2011-2012 with eye trauma caused by wooden items such as sticks and branches. There were a total of 67 cases, 24 of which occurred in males between the ages of 51 and 67. The accidents mostly took place while playing, gardening, or working in the forest. The takeaways here are pretty straightforward: consider eye protection for forestry and woodworking, and children should be careful while playing with sticksthough, notably, none of the playing-with-sticks injuries resulted in permanent disability.
Sri Lankan Sloth Bears
If youre out in the Sri Lankan jungle gathering honey or collecting the fruits of the ironwood or dragons eye trees, make lots of noise and look out for sloth bears. Theyre relatively small, maxing out at around three feet tall at the shoulders, but despite the name theyre faster than humansand they like those foods too. Most of the ten attacks reported by a team of Sri Lankan doctors took place while the victims were alone gathering food. All survived, but that could be because those who dont survive sloth bear attacks dont bother coming to the hospital.
Theres no shortage of other dangerous wildlife encounters described in the pages of Wilderness &amp; Environmental Medicine: scorpions in Amazonia, hump-nosed pit vipers in India, jaguar attacks in Brazil, multiple organ failure after wasp attacks, itchy stings from the white flannel moth caterpillar, and so on. Sometimes a little extra caution might protect you; other times theres nothing you can do other than be prepared. If you spend a lot of time in the backcountry, take a wilderness first-aid course, pack a comprehensive first-aid kit, and leave the slugs and mushrooms alone.

The red panda is one of the most adorable wild animals. Despite its resemblance to the giant panda and sharing a common name, this animal is a distinct species.
Weve prepared a definitive collection of the 30 most remarkable things to know about red pandas before they (God forbid) go extinct.
1. Red Pandas Are Not the Real Pandas
Red pandas aren’t considered real pandas. That title goes to the giant panda. Despite sharing a common name, the red panda and the giant panda are phylogenetically different.
The red panda belongs in the Ailuridae family. Members of this family include raccoons, skunks, and weasels.
Giant pandas, on the other hand, belong in the family Ursidae. They share the same phylogenetic relationships with most regular bears, particularly the spectacled bear.
2. Red Pandas Are Called The Lesser Pandas
The red panda is aptly christened ‘the lesser panda’ due to its smaller size compared to the giant panda.
A standard red panda measures 20.1 25.0 inches or 51 63.5 centimeters and sports an 11.0 19.1 inch (28 48.5 cm) tail. Also, these animals generally weigh around 7.1 33.1 pounds or 3.2 15 kilograms.
3. Red Pandas Are So Named For Their Reddish Fur
While the name panda in red panda relates to the animals similarity to the giant panda, the red part of the word resonates with their coat color.
The red pandas coat is predominantly red or orange-brown, with black legs and belly. Its tail also features a pattern of red while the rest of the body (cheeks, muzzle, and brows) are usually white.
4. Red Pandas Have a Fairly Small Native Range
All the world’s wild red pandas inhabit the Eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. China, Nepal, and Bhutan account for over 98% of the global red panda population.
5. Red Pandas Feed Almost Exclusively On Bamboo
Bamboo makes up over 97% of the red panda’s diet. Thats one of the fundamental features these animals share with the giant panda.
6. Red Pandas Are Fussy Eaters
Not only does the bulk of the red pandas diet come from bamboo. These animals are very particular on the bamboo parts and species that constitute their diet.
Red pandas mostly favor bamboo leaves and shoots. And they have a preference for bamboo plants in the genera Phyllostachys, Thamnocalamus, Sinarundinaria, and Chimonobambusa.
7. Red Pandas Are Not Obligate Herbivores
Despite their primary diet being bamboo, a plant, red pandas arent true herbivores.
Instead, theyre omnivores wholl occasionally snack on insects, small lizards, small birds, bird eggs, and small mammals.
8. Red Pandas Are Not Prolific Breeders
Red pandas breed only once annually, with much of the breeding taking place in early winter.
Besides, females are sexually receptive for just about three days during this period and wont mate with males outside the breeding season. This reproductive behavior makes the red panda one of the least prolific mammals.
9. Poaching Is a Serious Threat to the Red Panda Population
About 10,000 red pandas die annually from poaching-related activities. These critters are often killed for their fur.
10. Red Pandas Are Preyed Upon By Other Predators Too
One of the best things about the red panda’s natural habitat is that it’s relatively low on large carnivores. However, the Himalayan region is home to one of the world’s stealthiest predators the snow leopard.
Snow leopards will not hesitate to kill red pandas. The fact that both animals are arboreal increases the chances of deadly encounters. More unfortunate is the fact that snow leopards usually target young and defenseless red panda cubs.
Besides snow leopards, the red panda is also preyed upon by martens. Their cubs may also be hunted by large birds of prey or other smaller carnivores.
11. Red Pandas Are an Endangered Species..
Red pandas have featured on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s list of endangered animals since 2008. It’s estimated that there are less than 10,000 red pandas globally and this population has been on a downward trend over the last few years.
Factors like small native range, habitat loss, poaching, predation, reproduction challenges, and limited nutrition are responsible for the ever-dwindling number of red pandas.
12. ..But There Are Heightened Conservation Efforts to Preserve the Species
The red panda is one of the most protected animals. There are scores of organizations committed to conserving wild red pandas and their natural habitats.
Noteworthy examples include the Red Panda Network and the World Wildlife Fund.
13. It Is Illegal To Adopt Red Pandas
You can adopt most wild animals for pets, including the very wild and ferocious ones like tigers and crocodiles.
However, it’s illegal to trade in the red panda. That consequently makes it illegal to keep red pandas as pets.
The illegal possession of red pandas could have you slapped with hefty fines. And depending on local animal conservation laws, you could end up serving a very long jail term.
14. Red Pandas Dont Want To Be Kept As Pets Either
Even if it were legal to keep red pandas as pets, you would still face immeasurable challenges fending for these animals basic needs.
Thats especially considering their restrictive diets. Besides, red pandas are more at home in their wild bamboo-rich forests.
15. Red Pandas Are Extremely Arboreal
Red pandas spend more than 90% of their time up in the trees. They typically curl themselves up in the trees and rest their heads against branches.
Their flexible joints and semi-retractable claws make the panda incredibly adapted for tree living.
16. Red Pandas Are Crepuscular
Contrary to popular belief, red pandas aren’t diurnal creatures. They arent nocturnal either. Instead, these adorable animals are crepuscular.
Crepuscular animals are generally more active at dawn and dusk. Hopefully, you know when to hit the woods on your next red panda sightseeing tour.
17. Red Pandas Can Sleep For Up To 16 Hours
Red pandas are some of the sleepiest creatures on the planet. These animals will slumber for up to two-thirds of their time.
The bulk of their waking hours goes to feeding and migrating vertically (up and down their habitat trees) depending on the conditions of the day.
18. Red Pandas Glow in the Dark
The white markings on the red pandas face are nearly luminescent. Panda cubs are known to reunite with their lost mothers in the dark by following their glowing faces. Thats a wonderful feature bearing in mind how endangered these critters are.
19. Red Panda Eyes Are Adapted To Block Sunrays
Nearly all red pandas have reddish tear tracks extending from their eyes, the same feature observable in cheetahs.
The tear marks give pandas a distinctive look. But they also help keep the sun out of their eyes, a welcome feature considering that the panda spends the majority of his time high up the tree canopies.
20. Red Pandas Have a Sweet Tooth
A 2009 study appearing in The Journal of Heredity revealed a specific dietary behavior in red pandas that was largely unknown until then.
In this program, researchers served a variety of Carnivoran animals with bowls of plain water, naturally flavored water, and artificially flavored water. To their surprise, the red panda demonstrated a marked preference for three artificial sugars sucralose (Splenda), neotame, and aspartame (Nutrasweet or Equal).
These findings made the red panda the fourth animal and the only non-primate species to be able to taste aspartame. The others include humans, apes, and Old World monkeys.
21. Red Pandas Are Quackers
Red pandas are generally silent creatures who can easily fly under the radar. However, these animals are quite vocal and can make a variety of sounds. They can tweet, squeal, hiss, grunt, and even quack.
22. Red Pandas Have Been Around For Millions Of Years…..
Red panda fossils suggest that these animals have been around for more than 5 million years.
The findings also indicate that the red panda once prowled all the continents before its habitat began to shrink.
23. …..But the Species Was Described More Recently
The first formal description of the red panda was in 1825 by Frederic Cuvier. That’s when the animal received its species name ‘Ailurus fulgens.’
Interestingly, the red panda was described several years before the giant panda. The first official description of the giant panda was in 1869 by French missionary Pere Jean Pierre Armand David.
24. There Are Two Red Panda Subspecies
The red panda falls into two broad sub-species. They include the Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens fulgens) and the Chinese red panda (Ailurus fulgens styani).
The two panda species are believed to have genetically diverged some 250,000 years ago and their names pretty much denote the specific regions where they inhabit.
25. Red Pandas Hibernate
The red pandas natural habitat experiences extreme conditions at various points in the year. During winter when temperatures plummet to sub-zero degrees, these critters will wrap their tail around their bodies and go into a deep slumber.
This behavioral adaptation doesnt constitute hibernation in the normal sense of the word. Rather, its known as going into torpor, a state of physiological inactivity. It generally entails a reduction in metabolic rate, respiration rate, and core body temperature.
26. Red Pandas Can Incredibly Blend In
Since theyre an easy target for humans and other predators, its important for red pandas to blend perfectly into their surroundings. A single red panda death is simply one too many.
Fortunately, red pandas are incredibly adapted for their environment. Their reddish-orange coat allows them to disappear into fir trees when pursued by predators.
27. Red Pandas Go By Many Names
The red panda is known by numerous names, including both English and local names. These animals may be referred to as false panda to differentiate them from true pandas the giant panda. They may also be called the first panda to indicate that they were described before the giant panda or the lesser panda in reference to their relatively smaller size compared to the giant panda.
Other common English names for the red panda include firefox, the red cat-bear, and the red bear-cat. In Nepal, red pandas are known as bhalu biralo while in Tibet, theyre called ye niglva ponva or wah donka.
28. Red Pandas Have False Thumbs
Red pandas have opposable thumb-like appendages that they use for grabbing bamboo. This is another feature that they share in common with the giant panda.
Besides, red pandas have six digits on their toes, another handy feature that enables them to scale high bamboo twigs.
29. Red Pandas Can Stand On Their Hind Legs
Red pandas are known to stand on their hind legs when provoked or threatened.
This behavior, also evident in other animals like bears, is intended to make the panda appear larger and more intimidating.
30. Captive Red Pandas Can Live For 14 Years
A red panda can live for an average of 14 years in captivity or even longer if the conditions are right.
The oldest red panda ever recorded was a male panda from the Rotterdam Zoo in the Netherlands. He lived for 21 years and 7 months.
Final Word
Numerous factors are working in favor of the red panda extinction. Therefore, it should be everyones solemn duty to preserve whats left of this beautiful species.
The good news is that you dont need to live within the red pandas native range to play a part in protecting them from extinction. Not when you can make monetary donations to relevant conservation groups like the Red Panda Network. Besides, you could use your blogs and social media handles as platforms for speaking out against mans savage onslaught on the red panda.

iRunFar’s feature article about the 2022 Snowman Race in Bhutan.
The 2022 Snowman Race: To Hold Hope Lightly by Meghan Hicks.",https://irunfar.com/the-2022-snowman-race-to-hold-hope-lightly,https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.irunfar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/21135212/2022-Snowman-Race-Karchung-La-feature.jpg,2023-04-26T10:00:35Z,"Karma Yangden is a Bhutanese yak herder and cordyceps collector. The former is one of the countrys major domestic animals which produce dairy products, and which are used to transport goods through remote Bhutan. Cordyceps is a medicinal fungus that grows in the Bhutanese highlands and that fetches a large commercial price tag.
The 31-year-old Layup is a mother of three, her oldest two midway through their teens and her youngest a toddler. The Layaps are one of the dozens of indigenous peoples groups hailing from the Himalaya of Bhutan.

Karma is also the womens champion of the 2022 Snowman Race, a five-day, 200-kilometer (125 miles) stage race in northern Bhutan.
Karma didnt take up running as a kid. Runnings a relatively nascent sport in Bhutan so no one has done that yet. She picked up running about five years ago when runners turned up in her village, Laya, as part of the then newly minted Royal Highland Festival, a weekend celebration of Bhutans diverse highlands peoples.
The 25-kilometer (15 miles) Laya Run takes place as part of this festival and in it participants race from the village of Gasa, located at 2,850 meters (9,350 feet) altitude, to Laya, at 3,820 meters (12,500 feet) altitude.
Karma first ran in the rubber boots many highlands peoples wear to ward off the mud, water, snow, and cold which are replete there. Today, she dresses like any runner youd see the world over though she moves faster when she runs than most high altitude mountain running women, and certainly faster than the rest of us ladies who took part in the Snowman Race.
Born, raised, and living an outdoor-based life at high altitude, its easy to see why shes physically good at trail running and ultrarunning and why she would thrive at a long trail race through her countrys highlands.

But we all know that the best trail runners and ultrarunners have more than just cultivated physical ability. They also possess the psychological ability to adapt quickly to the challenges that arise during laborious runs.
In the West, we use the word resilience to describe this character trait. We say that a resilient person is one who can withstand or who bounces back well after encountering a problem.
The term equanimity offers an Eastern approach to this capability. For Buddhists, equanimity is a state of calmness no matter what difficulties one experiences.
As I will learn through 2.5 weeks of living, running, traveling, and getting to know her while in Bhutan to participate in the Snowman Race, Karma has had an extraordinarily difficult past. Shes previously been a child wife and a teenage mom, and she is a survivor of domestic abuse. Less than two years ago, the Laya village experienced a climate change disaster, and she lost relatives to it.
Id venture a guess that most of her adaptability thus comes from her lived experience and that running is the easy part.

A Kings Crazy Idea
Bhutan is a small South Asian country of about 730,000 people, landlocked between geographic behemoths, China to the north and India to the south.
The Himalaya arcs across the northern half of the country, some of the ranges peaks drawing the border with Tibet. Among this tangle of rock, glaciers, snow, and water, the mountain Gangkhar Puensum, at 7,570 meters (24,840 feet) altitude, rises as Bhutans highest feature. In the southern part of the country, the land lowers to about 90 meters (300 feet) above sea level. Remarkably, all of this happens over a small distance, as Bhutan is only about the size of The Netherlands or two New Jerseys combined.

Bhutan is a constitutional monarchy, meaning it has a king, who is the head of state, as well as a voted-in prime minister who is the head of government. This is the same leadership status as, for example, England or Morocco. While the monarchy part of Bhutans leadership is five generations in, the first democratically appointed prime minister was only voted into office in 2008.
The present king is named Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Hes ruled over the country since his father, the prior king, gave up his throne in 2008. Hell reign over Bhutan until he says its time for him to go, passing the throne to the older of his two sons.
His Majesty The King, as he is referred to by the Bhutanese people, is younger than me and has ruled the country since I was busy doing dumb things in bars as a 20-something-year-old. He and the rest of the royal family are as royal as they get, elevated to the highest level of respect and admiration by the Bhutanese people. Its the sort of respect for leadership that, as an American late Gen Xer, Ive not seen afforded to an American leader.
His Majesty The King is an athlete. Hes a hiker, mountain biker, and runner. In 2022, for example he told us this story himself when we met him after the Snowman Races conclusion he did a half-marathon-distance sightseeing run with a French friend in Paris, France, while traveling to attend the funeral of Englands Queen Elizabeth. This is to say that His Majesty The King can motor.

Somewhere around 2018, His Majesty The King decided the country should host a race on the Snowman Trek, a remote, long-distance route stretching in an open horseshoe shape roughly east to west through the roadless Himalayan foothills, from outside the city of Paro in the west and the town of Bumthang in the east. The Snowman Trek strings together historic trails set, and still widely used, by highlands peoples to bring supplies via livestock to, from, and between their communities. The entirety of the Snowman Trek is about 350 kilometers (218 miles) in length. Given that they are mostly used by livestock and that they receive little to no maintenance, these trails are little like what Westerners think of as trails. They are braided, have erosion and drainage issues, are really rocky in some places and incredibly muddy in others, and are just plain rugged in comparison to trails of the West.
Along the Snowman Trek, theres just one reasonable shortcut point, about two-thirds of the way west on the route, where the route passes closest to the village of Gasa. From Gasa to Bumthang on the Snowman Trek is about 203 kilometers (126 miles). Hiking expeditions along the whole route are slotted at about a month long, and treks of the eastern two thirds generally go three weeks in length.
His Majesty The King and the Bhutan government eventually decided that the Snowman Race, as it would be called, should be run on that 200-ish-kilometer distance from Gasa to Bumthang, in a five-day, stage-race format. Participants around 30, hailing from Bhutan and countries around the world, chosen based on qualifying events and a proven ability to thrive in high altitude backcountry environments would sleep between each of the five days at backcountry camps established ahead of time by the race organization.

Thing is, such a thing had not been done in Bhutan before sending out a passel of athletes to cover this long distance over a compressed period of time and through terrain only accessible by foot. In fact, only a few running races of any kind are held in Bhutan each year.
So, the Snowman Race Secretariat was established by the government and populated with everyone relevant to making such a thing happen: the governments military, geographers, meteorologists, tourism administrators, communications managers, and many others. The secretariat also enlisted the help of experienced race director, ultrarunner, and all-around good guy Luis Escobar and his merry band of race organizers for the project.
In late 2019, the Snowman Race came to public life, announcing that it would begin on October 13, 2020, on the ninth wedding anniversary of His Majesty the King and Her Majesty The Queen of Bhutan. Then the COVID-19 pandemic stopped the progress of basically everything, shuttering tourism in Bhutan for about 2.5 years and the Snowman Race along with it.
But the Bhutanese are nothing if not resilient ahem, equanimous and just as soon as the country reopened for tourism in the fall of 2022, the Snowman Race was set to start on the 11th royal wedding anniversary in October.
When the inaugural event was done and dusted, and we participants were safely back in the capital city of Thimphu, His Majesty The King and Her Majesty The Queen granted to us a Royal Audience. There, Her Majesty The Queen, Jetsun Pema, shared with us that when her husband first told her his idea of the Snowman Race years back, she had thought, Oh, this is another of his crazy ideas.
Her Majesty The Queen is correct, this was a crazy idea.
The Climate Still Changes in a Carbon-Neutral Country
Bhutan is one of the worlds only carbon-neutral countries, in that it offsets at least as much carbon as it uses. If youve been working on understanding and reducing your own carbon footprint, then you know that this is an unusual status for a single human being, let alone an entire country.
Bhutans carbon neutrality is achieved largely through hydropower, the energy harnessed from several of the countrys biggest river systems cascading out of the Himalaya in the countrys north to its sea-level terrain in the south. The nations carbon-neutral status is also achieved because its citizens consume relatively few resources generally.

All of this said, the critical idea I want to convey is that Bhutan is carbon neutral because it wants to be. The environment is and has for a long time been front and center in government policy, treated at the policy level as equal in value to the health of the Bhutanese people and the countrys economy.
This concept that the environment and, therefore, the climate crisis, are together a fundamental prong of national policy is singular in national governments worldwide. There is no other country that has placed the environment, and, these days, the climate crisis, central to its operations. In most countries, capitalism reigns and the economy is valued higher than the natural environment and, if I can be frank, even the health of its human population.
Climate change scientists tell us that climate change more heavily impacts rural communities than people living in cities. There are several reasons for this, but this is strongly a result of how closely rural people live to the land, deriving their food and personal economies from right there. When that land changes, so must the lives of those people.
Most of Bhutan is rural, save for a few dozen square miles around a couple of cities. The climate is changing everywhere in the world, and of course everywhere in Bhutan, yet in Bhutan its more prominently felt by its rural communities.

The people who live rurally in Bhutan that is, the people who have the lowest environmental impact in a climate-neutral country are among the people feeling the impacts of climate change the most. That is something, isnt it.
The rural people of Bhutan have been and will continue to be subject to climate-crisis emergencies, like floods, landslides, glacial lake outburst flood events, and other life-altering disasters, in addition to the slow creep of a changing climate and what that means for heating ones home, watering ones crops, and caring for ones livestock.
His Majesty The King established the Snowman Race with the purpose of teaching the world about the heightening climate emergency in Bhutan. Using the Snowman Trek linkup of traditional trails and highlands villages, the Snowman Race would put participants in the literal face of the rising crisis. In fact, the races tagline is The Ultimate Race for Climate Action.
The idea is that we runners would meet the climate crisis face-to-face, and then bring our experiences back home to share what we saw and learned, with the goal of showing how in a global ecosystem everything is connected, and that even a carbon-neutral country is not exempt from climate change. In fact, more often than not, us Snowman Race participants were referred to as messengers rather than competitors.

The Intimacy of Buddhism
On our first full day in Bhutan we have arrived about a week before the Snowman Race start in order to acclimatize to the altitude, experience a little of Bhutans frontcountry, and organize the logistics of such a remote event we visit Paro Taktsang, which is better known at least outside of Bhutan by its alternate name of Tigers Nest Monastery. If its true that first impressions are everything, then Bhutan is hitting the ball out of the park here.

Well, our true first impression of the country was of the sporty Druk Air Airbus landing into the Paro, Bhutan, airport, which is nestled into a valley at times just a half mile wide. That was definitely the first time Ive looked out the windows of a large commercial airplane to see homes, terraces, and grain paddies at a painfully close distance to a massive metal tube trying to transition from hurtling through the sky at a couple hundred miles per hour to being still on the earth.
But I digress. This incredible monastery clings to a forested cliff high above the Paro Chu valley chu means river or water in Dzongkha, the official language of Bhutan upstream from the city of Paro.
To visit Paro Taktsang, one hikes about five kilometers (three miles) uphill and climbs about 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) from the trailhead, one way. While these statistics may sound reasonable to the seasoned trail runner, its a challenging, full-day adventure for most folks.
Paro Taktsangs origin story lends itself to its common name. In Tibetan, taktsang means tigers lair, and one of the monasterys origin myths is that the eighth century guru Padmasambhava arrived at this location from Tibet riding a tiger and mediated here.
In the 17th century, the first monastery was built at the site. Today, it contains four ornate temples as well as private residences and classrooms for monks and those studying to be one. Its also a pilgrimage destination for Bhutanese Buddhists and tourists alike.

While the Bhutanese runners greeted us international runners at the airport when we arrived yesterday evening, and we ate dinner together last night, both were fairly formal, and we were all reserved and quiet. Todays hike to Paro Taktsang is the first group activity for the Snowman Races 29 runners in which we get to informally spend time together.
Most of the Bhutanese runners have been here before, some multiple and a few dozens of times. Of course, its a first voyage for all of us international runners. In two large shuttle buses, we carpool to the base of the mountain, and then hike together in small groups to the site.
Vajrayna Buddhism is the countrys official religion, and Buddhism is integrated into all aspects of Bhutanese society. Theres no separation of church and state or of spirituality and sports, or of time spent praying and time spent with new friends, in our case.
The Bhutanese runners pray freely as we walk and talk, whispering prayers in one breath and asking get-to-know-you questions in the next. And as we hike, they pause briefly to spin the prayer wheels next to the trail, walk circles around the statues and features inside the temples, and make small cash offerings around the monastery.
While it may not feel this way for the Bhutanese runners, who are, I imagine, carrying on similarly to their daily lives, these hours feel intimate for me. We are invited deep into the halls of one religions sacred space, and we bear witness to the way near strangers interact with their spirituality. And for about five minutes inside one of the temples, we sit together, some of us meditating and others of us quietly absorbing the experience.
The effect of the day at Paro Taktsang is powerful, for the way it accelerates the development of our groups comfort and intimacy. The shuttle bus ride back to the hotel afterward is a lot louder, goofier, and more casual than the one to the trailhead just a few hours ago. First impressions really are everything.

Snowman Race Day 1: An Auspicious Start
My alarm rings here in Gasa, Bhutan, but Ive already been awake for a few minutes. My phone screen says its 3:30 a.m. on October 13, 2022. The inaugural edition of the Snowman Race begins in a few hours.
For a moment, I lie still. I wonder about the monks a few miles up the hill at Gasa Dzong, a historic fortress that now serves as the religious and administrative epicenter of the Gasa district of Bhutan and where the event will start at 6 a.m., and if they are awake.

A few days ago, Gasa Dzongs head monk, Tshering Penjor, welcomed the Snowman Race participants and a few of its many organizers into the dzong. Over tea and momos, served to our group of about 40 in one of the dzongs ornately decorated temples by some of the monks who live, study, and pray there, he said it was his and the monks job to ensure the events auspicious a word meaning lucky or fortuitous that is used frequently in Bhutan, and which is probably co-opted into everyday language from Buddhism’s Ashtamangala or eight auspicious symbols passage through Gasa district.
He explained then that already the monks had begun their prayers for the event, and that they would wake up early on race morning to perform a prayer ritual for us.

Gasa Dzong is perched atop a hillside near the top of Gasa village, its profile dominated by three watchtowers. The dzong was built in the 17th century to help protect the region from invaders from whats now the Tibetan Autonomous Region, located to the north of Bhutan. Though the region has experienced peace for hundreds of years, maintaining regional safety and function remains a serious matter for the districts religious and administrative leadership.
When we arrive at Gasa Dzong around 5 a.m., the monks sit with their legs crossed beneath them, in several long rows in a classroom, chanting. We racers are welcomed to watch and listen. Scripture books, one for every two or three monks, sit in front of them, but they seem to chant more from memory than the books.
Young to old, they dress in their traditional red garments, their eyes tilted downward toward the ground, save for stolen glances in our direction, they perhaps as curious about us as we are of them. We would learn later that one of Karma Yangdens teenage sons who is studying to be a monk is in this group praying.
At 6 a.m. sharp, as light begins to flood the inky blue sky of a receding night, and after the most ornate starting ceremony Ive yet witnessed in a lifetime of running race starts, a starters pistol sends us 29 athletes running toward the highlands.

Snowman Race Day 1: She Soars
Ive reached the finish line of the Snowman Races first stage American Roxy Vogel and I descended from the trail down to our campsite and crossed the line hand-in-hand, the two of us having spent the final 90 minutes of high altitude meandering together.
Most of the 29 of us will make it here, to Night Halt 1, located at about 4,940 meters (16,200 feet) above sea level, though some of us will arrive after dark. Those of us who dont will be too affected by the altitude to get here, though none of us escape its imposition completely.

Camp sits amongst hummocky highlands terrain. Mountains immediately to our south rise almost 1,000 more meters (3,280 feet) above us. The scene is figuratively as breathtaking as the altitude is literally so.
Roxy and I promptly begin the chore of putting ourselves back together again so that we can do the same thing tomorrow. We drink recovery drinks, wash our muddy shoes, socks, and legs in a creek, and climb into dry clothes. Were not in camp for 30 minutes when an avalanche releases from the face of one of the mountains, the snow roaring as it tumbles, cascading out of view behind an enormous lateral moraine.
Moraines are the piles of rocks which are left behind the front and sides of a glacier as it recedes, the detritus of the earth its chewed up on its slow march. During the final hour or so of running into camp, we had sneaking glimpses behind the moraine of a turquoise lake and endless piles of rocks. Well learn later that this giant moraine once formed one of the boundaries of a glacier which poured itself off those mountains and out into the flatter terrain a kilometer further than it does now. We learn that it is one of many examples well see in the coming days of glacial retreat and an in-our-face lesson of climate change.
A glacial lake in the Bhutanese Himalaya, near Night Halt 1 of the 2022 Snowman Race. As you can see, water is pooling in the moraine, or rocks left by a retreating glacier, to form the lake. If a glacial lake grows too large too fast due to glacial melting, it is at risk of bursting from the moraine and causing a catastrophic flood, what scientists call a glacial lake outburst flood. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell
If I can be honest, today is also a lesson in the slowness of forward progress here. We cover something like 46.5 kilometers (29 miles) and gain something like 3,080 meters (10,100 feet). It takes me 9 hours and 41 minutes on the race clock. Our pace is muted by a trio of variables, of course by that altitude, the five-kilogram (11 pounds) pack of mandatory equipment were carrying to stay safe, and the mud that is omnipresent when you are below treeline.
Though the going was slow, it was spectacular. From Gasa, we first traveled north, up the Mo Chu valley before turning east into a feeder drainage until we arrived to Roduphu, a small outpost hugging the side of a wide, flat valley composed of a few empty rock huts occasionally used for Bhutanese military patrols, nomadic locals, and Snowman Trek travelers. After Roduphu, the trail hucked itself skyward in the days steepest pitch.
All day the weather was moody, offering only caged glances of the high ridges and peaks, with a bit of rain, snow flurries, and graupel. As I climbed out of Roduphu, I looked forward and backward, at the long string of us runners grinding uphill. Among us was one person moving faster than everyone else: Karma Yangden.
Quickly she scampered past me, jumping from rock to rock as we crossed back and forth over a wide stream. It wasnt long until she and her easily identifiable red hat disappeared over a knoll, and she went on to reach the night halt something like 20 minutes ahead of me.
While we runners are always reaching for our own flow state, the only thing that might be better is seeing another endurance runner in their own. I loved watching Karma soar up here, amongst the rocks and the sky.
Snowman Race Day 2: Where Wild Things Roam
When we are released off the starting line in the pre-dawn of Day 2, we runners slow-motion slingshot toward the sky. Sure, were plenty energetic and our eagerness has yet no bounds, but that altitude has a chokehold on all of that, so our pace doesnt quite match our vitality.

Our first destination for today is Karchung La, one of the major passes well traverse this week. It sits at 5,164 meters (16,940 feet), is blanketed with a thin snow layer, and is adorned with a couple dozen prayer flags.
We are already up high, but Karchung Las northeast view is of a wall of peaks, which are much higher. This is the second day of my first visit to the Himalaya, and yesterday the high peaks hid shyly in the clouds. This mornings sky is almost cloudless and this view is insane.
We were told ahead of time that the Bhutanese athletes, the nine of which participating in this race, divided into four women and five men, would likely take a moment to pray at each pass walking a clockwise circle around the passs largest cairn in the same way and for the same purpose that they circumambulate the prayer wheels, temples, and chortens back in civilization, a Buddhist spiritual practice.
We are a train of women when we arrive at Karchung La, a mix of Bhutanese and international participants. Im not exactly sure what I was expecting but what happens next is entirely unexpected. Any prayers being said by anyone were to oneself as the Bhutanese ladies launch down the pass like little rockets just alighted. This is a race and they mean business.
Australian Nicki Rehn and I are left alone. We snap a quick selfie, squawk about the view, and then drop in and let it rip. The snow on the trail is stomped flat, provides great traction, and squeaks as cold snow does.

Something like two thirds of the way down from Karchung La to the river valley far below us, the sun finally reaches us and the trail quickly turns from squeaky to slushy. Nicki, U.S. runner Sarah Keyes, and I come to rest with our eyes on the relatively fresh track of a wild animal through the snow, which fell a couple nights ago. I snap a couple photos.
Were pretty sure its a wild cat track it looks nearly identical in size and shape to the mountain lion tracks I occasionally see where I live in the Western U.S. Tonight, at Night Halt 2, well confirm with a forestry official there that this is indeed the track of a snow leopard, one of the shyest, rarest, and most endangered wild cats in the world.

We are still traveling northeast, as we have been since Roduphu yesterday afternoon during Day 1, and well continue this way until we reach the river valley. That meeting point will be the closest weve gotten thus far to the Bhutan-Tibet border, under 11 kilometers (7 miles) as the raven flies from there. And we are in the thick of Jigme Dorji National Park, Bhutans second-largest national park, located here in the northern part of the country, and part of the 42% of the countrys area which is federally protected an insane amount of real estate compared to most other nations wildscape preserves to help conserve wildlife populations like that of the rare snow leopard as well as the agrarian way of life of the rural Bhutanese.
We three continue downhill, continuing what will be a hours-long game of leapfrog well down the river valley, with Sarah first taking point, Nicki on the middle spot, and me the caboose. I can just barely make out Nicki shouting as we bounce amongst the slush, mud, and the views of the biggest mountains I have personally ever seen.
She couldnt be more precise as she shouts, This is wild!
Snowman Race Day 3: What Goes Up Must Come Down
The bigness of Days 1 and 2 were childs play in comparison to what we will experience on Day 3. Today we will crest the highest point of the race, Gophu La la is pass in Dzongkha, but maybe youve sorted that out at 5,472 meters (17,955 feet) altitude.
Its not only a lofty destination, but its also the most remote part of the Snowman Race course, and it additionally marks the boundary between Jigme Dorji National Park and Wangchuck Centennial National Park, the latter the largest national park of the country. This will be the kind of wild Ive not experienced before.
But, way bigger than all this, and in order to get from where we are, a village called Lhedi in the Pho Chu valley, to Gophu La in the first place, we must travel through the site of one of Bhutans biggest examples of climate change.
Glacial lakes are lakes which form at the base of generally receding and melting glaciers, their melt water bunching up on the moraine. In these settings, the glacial melt water is held back by rock piles as young as the water itself, not some ancient, hard bedrock. Sometimes, too, what scientists call dead ice is in that moraine, glacial remnants that make the moraine impenetrable to glacial lake water.
As the lakes grow, they mostly leak just enough water into the earth and the drainages below them to exist sustainably. Rarely, but with increasing frequency as the climate rapidly warms, they fill until they burst in whats called a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF).
On October 6 and 7, 1994, the glacial lake Lugge Tscho tscho is lake in Dzongkha burst, and violently flooded the river valley below it. Twenty-one people up and down the Pho Chu valley died, more were injured, livestock killed, property destroyed, and the whole of the river valley changed form with flood waters heavily eroding some parts of the valley, ripping out thousands of trees and vegetation along with it, and depositing sediment that rendered prior agrarian terrain unusable.
During Day 3 of the 2022 Snowman Race, looking down the Pho Chu valley toward the village of Lhedi in the distant right, miles of boulders fill the valley, which were deposited in the Lugge Tscho glacial lake outburst flood. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks
These lakes and their GLOFs have been studied in detail around the world, including in the Himalaya. Scientists have concluded that some of them are the natural outcomes of the retreat of the Little Ice Age, the worlds most recent ice age, and others are the result of climate change. The Lugge Tscho GLOF was an effect of climate change.
For more than 16 kilometers (10 miles) on the morning of Day 3, we travel up the valley containing Pho Chu and see how the valley was changed by the Lugge Tscho GLOF. In doing so, I fall into a lady gang. There are five of us women running and powerhiking in lockstep, Bhutanese runners Lhamo and Kinzang Lhamo, Americans Roxy Vogel and Emily Keddie, and myself.
Lhamo and Kinzang essentially take turns pacesetting, and us Americans fall mostly into line behind them. We are working together, chatting a bunch, and overall friendly as all heck, but there is some gaming happening too.
The Bhutanese ladies are moving conservatively, more so than Ive seen them move all week, clearly not wanting to work too hard so early in this really hard day. And Roxy, Emily, and I are a little antsy and naïve, in my case at least making small breaks here and there to move a little harder. But Lhamo and Kinzang cover each move, and we end up close together for all of these first 10 miles.
During Day 3 of the 2022 Snowman Race, runners approach the village of Tschojong. From left to right are Kinzang Lhamo, Emily Keddie, Lhamo, and Roxy Vogel. On the right of the photo, severe river bank erosion due to the Lugge Tscho glacial lake outburst flood is visible. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks
Soon we are at the edge of a village called Tschojong, which appropriately translates from Dzongkha as valley of the lake. Were just a few kilometers downstream from Lugge Tscho and at least three other lakes which have names on the map and which scientists say are high risk lakes for GLOFs.
Locals have come out to watch our progress, two elders offering us yak cheese and slices of apples for our journey way up here above treeline and in such a remote spot, these offerings are of high value. Domestic yaks bathe in the river and graze. The sun has risen above the mountain tops, melting frost off the tundra and lifting our spirits toward the line of glacier-covered peaks to our north, some of them 7,080 meters (23,250 feet) tall. We women race together in a friendly competitorship always kind but always pushing to rise us all higher. The scene is, for me, as idyllic as one could imagine a race through the Bhutanese Himalaya to be.
But we know all is not entirely well in this valley, and soon we are running atop more evidence of its sordid past. A several-kilometer long set of sand dunes deposited here by the Lugge Tscho GLOF is one of the multiple physical reminders of the flood in this valley.
A view looking up the valley from the village of Tschojong during the 2022 Snowman Race. Evidence of the Lugge Tscho glacial lake outburst flood can be seen via river bank erosion and large sand dunes in the distance. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks
We make our way up the valley, through one more settlement, and across the impressive Pho Chu on an equally impressive metal suspension bridge. I reflect on how this river must have raged during that GLOF.
It is thus with some solemnity that we begin a big climb up one of the valleys shoulders toward Gophu La. I try my best to sear these moments into memory, so that I can share this story with you. But to be frank, there is no trying, a little piece of my heart stays in the valley bottom, even as our bodies rise higher.
Our ladies enchainment eventually thins out, as we find our own paces in the equally thinning air. For me that means coming to a brief halt with my heiney on the tundra to eat a Snickers bar; Im on the edge of bonking and weve got a long way to go, so its time to take in a lot more calories.
If snarfing a Snickers is a typical ultrarunner scene, then so is the puke-and-rally that follows. Weve ticked past the 5,000-meter (16,400 feet) mark, and I guess my body is telling me that its time for liquid calories only.
After what seems like a very long time, I finally crest Gophu La. Its more like the highest hill of a massive plateau than a steep headwall, and waiting here is a member of the Bhutanese army, one of a several dozen of these folks who are assigned to help keep us safe this week.
I snap a couple photos, listen to him radio my bib number into the Snowman Secretariat base which is monitoring the races progress all week back in the city of Thimphu, take in the long light of the afternoon, and feel overcome by a sense of euphoria.
A view looking backward on the 2022 Snowman Race course from near the race’s high point, a pass called Gophu La, which is 5,472 meters (17,955 feet) tall. Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks
I am well fueled and my body feels good, Ive now passed all the members of this morning’s lady gang, and Ive even come up close behind the first and second place women for today, Karma Yangden and Tashi Chozom, the latter of whom is the fourth Bhutanese woman in the race.
Along with the joy comes a small sense of smugness. I think, With a little oomph Ill catch the women in front of me and well be into the night halt by sunset.
This is well and truly a case of famous last words because soon the course markings become sparse so I begin navigating by the Gaia app on my phone, which requires slower movement. Next a fog comes up the valley and envelops everything more than 100 feet away, preventing me from using any long-view landmarks to navigate, slowing things some more. Then night follows, which means ones worldview is limited to the glow of your headlamp. And finally, the campsite is nowhere to be seen at the GPS point weve been given for it.
The next several hours are a hectic scene. First, Lhamo comes up behind me and we pair up to work together. Next, we sweep up Tashi who is coming backward on the course, convinced that weve missed the camp in the fog and night. Then, the three of us are swept up by all the runners behind us, whod also packed up into a couple groups to work together, as well as a couple members of the military whove decided we could use a little assistance in finding camp.
In fairness, we had been told that navigation, rather than simply following course markings, would be required during the race. However, up until Gophu La, the markings were so good Im not sure Id needed to navigate yet. Also, the race organization had told us that Night Halt 3 was further downstream from the GPS point we were given for it, as bad weather had damaged the planned campsite location. We were told to just keep going on the route until we got to camp. What we runners did not know was that the night halt was more than five kilometers (three miles) further. So when almost everything was obscured by fog and darkness, and we kept going without seeing any sign of camp for miles, it was easy to think wed missed it.
Once we arrive to camp safely as a huge group, and I lay my bruised ego and self down for a few hours of shuteye, I muse on how the highest highs seem to precede the lowest lows, and vice versa in ultrarunning, in life, and I guess in climate change too.

Snowman Race Day 4: Better Together
Ive known fellow Snowman Race participant Simon Mtuy, a Tanzanian runner, family man, mountain guide, and farmer, for some 15 years. I met him in the summer of the late two thousand aughts, he holed up in the higher reaches of Californias Sierra Nevada, training for the revered Western States 100, where I was working and living at the time. Our friendship has endured since then.

I speak the tiniest bits of Simons first language, Kiswahili, courtesy of a couple college courses, a semester abroad in Tanzania, and some visits since then to East Africa. Simons always been willing to humor me and my horrible butcherings of his language.
That includes this moment, as we are making our way up the final climb of Day 4. Pole pole ndio mwendo, is a Kiswahili proverb literally translating to, slowly slowly is the way, and figuratively meaning that a measured approach is the best one.
Simon and I have leapfrogged each other all day, and in doing so weve whispered these words to each other each time we pass, peppering in some hoots and hollers of louder encouragement when weve accordioned out but the bends in the trail and breaks in the terrain allow us to glimpse one another.
It is often said that running is a fairly solitary endeavor. Unlike some sports which are built upon a team foundation, the vast majority of adults who run are not members of a running team. While running as a general sport may trend toward the solitary, ultrarunning is the niche corner of the sport where the help of others is essentially a requisite of our movement toward the finish line. An ultrarunner travels so far and for so long that they often cannot do so without the aid of someone, somewhere and sometimes quite a lot of it.
Maybe this is a reason some of us have an ultrarunning bent, that we have some not fully understood desire to share the experience with something beyond the inside of our own skulls? This is at least the case for me on this mountainside today.

At the far side of the lake is Night Halt 4, where runners would sleep after the fourth day of running. The lake’s altitude is 4,330 meters (14,200 feet). Photo: iRunFar/Meghan Hicks
I would also argue that working together is always better. You can always do more with others than you can do alone. Simon and I, we are both working pretty hard, and we are a bit tired on this fourth day at high altitude and after many kilometers covered, but his words of encouragement amplify my movement. We cross the finish line a minute or so apart, I most certainly having gotten there faster because of him.
Fast forward several days into the future, once the Snowman Race is over, to where Simon shares with me a bag of coffee hes farmed to enjoy back home. The bag of coffee bears his companys name: Umoja.
This is a Kiswahili word I immediately recognize, and which couldnt have a more appropriate meaning for our hike up that mountainside, our collective participation in this race, and our worlds necessary work on the problem of climate change.
Umoja means together, because of course it does.

Snowman Race Day 5: The Day the Whole Nation Ran with Us
While it might be a little easier to make it on the national news in country of less than a million people, and there is also the fact that the Snowman Race was ideated by the His Majesty The King of Bhutan himself, it becomes immediately clear during the final miles of Day 5, as we come off the remote Snowman Trek route and make our way along dirt and paved roads to the Snowman Races finish line in the center of the town of Bumthang, that everyone out here knows something of what weve been doing back there.
Karma Yangden wins the 2022 Snowman Race. Photo: iRunFar/Bryon Powell
First, there is an increased military presence, it seems like there are army guys every couple kilometers to ask us how were doing and radio in our race number to base.
Next its the schools, probably around six of them along the route to the finish line. At each one, all of the kids wait for us to pass, holding signs theyve made containing messages about the environment and cheering.
After that its the national volunteer group in Bhutan called the Desuups, something like the U.S.s long gone Civilian Conservation Corps. In their neon orange outfits they line the route, offering water and juice.
And finally there is the stadium finish line, filled with what has to be 1,000 people. I can count on one hand the number of ultrarunning races Ive been to with more than 1,000 fans at the finish line, yet here, in little Bhutan, they gather.

Ahead of me at the finish line by plenty of real estate is Karma Yangden, who wins the womens race, clear of the rest of the field by a cumulative two hours over five days of racing. Behind her are Kinzang Lhamo and Lhamo who take second and third. In the mens race, Gawa Zangpo of Bhutan earns the mens crown.
By the time I cross the finish line I feel like the whole nation has run with us this week. It makes me feel like this sport of traveling around in the mountains is more than just sating my wandering fever. That doing this, that being in this moment, that carrying those stories from all the way out there to you reading along here, matters at least a little.

To Hold Hope Lightly
In the early morning hours of June 16, 2021, heavy rains fell over a large swath of Bhutan and neighboring countries, triggering several flash floods and landslides in both Bhutan and Nepal, destroying property and stealing lives.
In the mountains above the Bhutanese village of Laya, home to 2022 Snowman Race womens champion Karma Yangden, a landslide broke loose and tore through a campsite filled with sleeping cordyceps collectors. Ten Layaps were killed, five were injured, and a bunch of the collected cordyceps was washed away.
Among the deceased were four of Karmas relatives.

It was the worst tragedy in remembered Laya history, but not the worst tragedy induced by a changing climate in Bhutanese history. Its just one amongst a growing collection of stories, several of which we saw the effects of during the Snowman Race.
Its terrifically ironic that the 2022 Snowman Race, an event with the tagline The Ultimate Race for Climate Action, womens champion is a survivor herself of a climate change disaster.
What now? This is the thought which has kept me awake at night in the time thats passed since the race finished.
What do we do with what we know about Karma and the way climate change is threatening her villages well-being? Of bearing witness to the signs and symptoms of the retreat of glaciers effect on the landscape of Bhutan? Of seeing villages of people whose lives changed once because of the climate crisis and whose lives will probably change again?
What actions do we Snowman Race participants take using the knowledge weve learned? And should we, can we have hope for a different future?

Westerners have an odd relationship with hope Im saying this as a Westerner with that relationship myself.
I hope its warm next week for our party!
I hope I have this baby soon!
I hope we can slow the climate crisis.
In those statements are wishes about things we cannot control: the weather, when a womans body decides a baby is fully baked, and if the leaders of powerful companies and nations, as well as billions of individual humans, will decide to reduce their environmental impacts.
Buddhism, Ive learned, prefers a more ethereal relationship with hope.

American Sharon Salzberg, author, Buddhist, and teacher of meditation and other Eastern practices, wrote, The hope resides in the certainty of relief not in specific outcomes, like getting exactly what we want; the hope comes from the way things actually are in this universe: This too shall pass.
This does not mean that Buddhists dont have hope, Sharon Salzberg says, rather that they endeavor to hold hope lightly. That is, it is not that they live in the absence of hope, but rather they live with an acceptance that our desires cannot infer outcome.
Running experts tell us this very same thing, that we should attach ourselves to the processes, but not the outcomes, of our running.
I hope I get on the podium at this weekends race, is a statement which hinges a working definition of success on the uncontrollable variables of the others who enter the race and how fast they run.
Id like to run within 10% of my PR on this course, is thus a more process-oriented approach to our running, setting the standard for success in circumstances over which we can control, like our speed, pacing, and strategy.

The idea of a light, Buddhist, process-centric approach to hope can also be found in an untitled poem of prized American poet Emily Dickenson. Heres the first stanza:
Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all 
Dickensons version of hope is, metaphorically, an unceasingly vocal song bird.
And perhaps literally, this hope is the notion of wanting to look forward and onward that is inside of us, that exists because and maybe in spite of the human condition.
Its this precise kind of hope, the ability of resiliency or equanimity, the action of proceeding lightly no matter what is happening around us, that I think I saw in the Bhutanese people in general, and in people like Karma Yangden specifically.

Dickensons poem has two more stanzas:
And sweetest in the Gale is heard And sore must be the storm That could abash the little BirdThat kept so many warm 
Ive heard it in the chillest land And on the strangest Sea Yet never in Extremity,It asked a crumb of me.
I learned so much during my weeks in Bhutan, but the most important thing that I learned is this: we all must, figuratively, sing.
His and Her Majesties The King and The Queen of Bhutan, the Snowman Race Secretariat, and the dozens of people who made this logistically improbable event happen for the purpose of conveying a message about climate change to the world, they sing. Karma Yangden and the other Bhutanese runners who live amidst a storm of global climate change swirling around them, they sing, too.
And so here I am, singing, too, holding onto hope just as lightly as my Western-raised brain can tolerate.

The post Space10 proposes linking NFTs to furniture to encourage better care appeared first on Dezeen.",https://www.dezeen.com/2022/12/20/space10-proposes-linking-nft-trees-furniture-encourage-better-care-design/,https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2022/12/space-10-carbon-banks-nft-ikea-froset-design_dezeen_2364_hero-600x600.jpg,2022-12-20T09:00:27Z,"IKEA's research lab Space10 has developed a concept for connecting a physical furniture piece to an ever-evolving NFT tree, which ""grows"" through acts of care to incentivise people to keep, repair and recycle their belongings.
In Space10's speculative design project Carbon Banks, the furniture in question is IKEA's wooden Froset chair, while the non-fungible token (NFT) is an augmented reality artwork of a tree that mirrors the item's real-life circumstances.
The tree grows bigger and lusher the longer a person keeps the chair, and it also responds when the chair is repaired, resold or traded for another item of furniture. At the end of its life, the chair can be recycled to trigger one final visualisation – an all-over blooming of flowers.
Carbon Banks is a speculative design project linking items of furniture to NFTs
Space10 created Carbon Banks in partnership with Berlin studio WINT Design Lab to explore the potential for digital assets such as NFTs to build an emotional bond to items in the real world and help us to see them as less disposable.
""We know that furniture waste is a big problem,"" Space10 creative Ryan Sherman told Dezeen. ""Yet an item of wooden furniture can double as a carbon store for decades – if not longer – if cared for and recycled correctly.""
""Within the ever-evolving landscape of NFTs, we saw an opportunity to explore this technology as a promising vehicle by which to promote circular behaviours.""
The NFT takes the form of a tree that grows with time and acts of care
With Carbon Banks, which Space10 is currently developing into a prototype, the experience begins when a person purchases a new Froset chair and scans the unique pattern on its seat with their phone.
This action ""mints"" their virtual tree, meaning the unique digital asset is recorded on a blockchain, after which it can be bought, sold or traded.
The owner would experience this action as the sprouting of a seedling that appears to grow from their chair in augmented reality.
The furniture would be linked to the tree by scanning its unique patterning
If the chair is traded or sold, the NFT goes with it and the change in ownership is registered on the blockchain when the new owner scans the chair and the previous owner approves the transfer.
These changes add new, unique growths to the tree, as do acts of repair and maintenance. The tree's character is also based on the production journey of the physical item, such as the type of wood used and the manufacturing location.
Creative studio Zünc developed Carbon Bank's visuals, aiming to celebrate the beauty of nature while also giving the tree a more stylised and ""grafted"" look, mixing species chosen for their symbolic associations to the chair and its story.
The tree would start as a seed
""There's a branch with oak leaves – a nod to the oak veneer of the IKEA Froset chair used in the film,"" said Zünc Studio. ""Pine needles are digitally pruned to resemble bonsai arrangements, a practice of care and patience.""
""And the ferns that unfurl after the repair of the leg are based on the resurrection fern, which felt appropriate.""
While NFTs have developed a reputation for being unsustainable due to the vast amounts of energy needed to power blockchains, Space10 explores how this might be changing on the Carbon Banks website and in a white paper developed with digital design studio Bakken &amp; Bæck.
The tree would grow over time and take on a unique, personalised shape
The researchers note that shifting to a more efficient proof-of-stake protocol – as modelled by blockchains such as Ethereum – can reduce their energy consumption by up to 99.95 per cent.
This opens up the opportunity to use blockchains for purposes other than speculation and investment, they say.
""NFT applications have evolved iteratively,"" Sherman explained. ""First there were 'digital originals' – one example being Crypto Punks – where collectability, community and exclusivity were key values.""
""Then we started seeing 'digital receipts': trackable tokens of ownership to physical objects,"" he continued.
""Now, there's a lot of digital twin work going on: adding a digital original to your physical object like 'buy a pair of sneakers IRL and also wear them in virtual spaces'. It's not that far from the mp3 download code you get with a vinyl record but the mp3s can be unique.""
If the chair is recycled, the tree becomes covered in white flowers
Space10 positions Carbon Banks as the next generation of NFTs, which the studio is terming ""digital amplifiers"" as the technology is designed to ""amplify"" aspects of a physical object.
""Digital amplifiers are linked to physical objects via the blockchain and augment the items they are attached to, visualising the history of an object, our relationship with it and encouraging new behaviours,"" Sherman said.
""It presents a unique time to move away from financial incentives towards care, where digital objects visualise and reward sustainable behaviours in our real world, creating opportunities for new forms of digital self-expression.""
NFT owners could interact with their trees in virtual environments
Space10 is a Copenhagen-based research and design lab that works with the IKEA brand. It frequently addresses issues of sustainability and circularity with its concepts, prototypes and products, spanning everything from open-source Bee Homes to furniture that would use artificial intelligence to tell owners how it can be updated.
The studio has also worked with architecture studio EFFEKT on a subscription-based collective living proposal called The Urban Village Project, which would bring together people of different generations with shared facilities.",,Dezeen,Tree Fern,,,0.7,0.85,"Climate and Energy, Forests, Governance, Other",Other,"Tree Fern (Cyathea spp.), Other",English

Kate Sessions in her 20s
After becoming the first woman to earn a degree in science from Berkeley in 1881, Kate Sessions (November 8, 1857–March 24, 1940) took a job teaching mathematics at a San Diego public school. It was a shock to leave the redwoods for what appeared to her a desert landscape — plants had always been her great love: She had spent her childhood climbing trees and filling her herbarium with wildflowers; as a teenager, she had made an art of elaborate flower arrangements; as a young scientist, she had reveled in the dazzling molecular structure of trees under her microscope. Restless to do something about the dearth of greenery in her new home, she launched her own nursery and flower shop. 
But then she dreamt bigger. 
Just before her thirty-fifth birthday, Kate persuaded the city of San Diego to let her lease a 30-acre piece of barren public land to use as growing grounds. In exchange, she grew 100 new trees in it each year and gave another 300 to be planted along the city’s streets, around its plazas, in its public school yards. Soon, San Diego was covered in pine, oak, elm, cypress, eucalyptus, and pepper trees.
People rushed to her nursery to populate their own gardens with beauty. Vivacious and warmhearted, clad in her practical working clothes, Kate greeted visitors with a hug and led them through garden — across the miniature meadow of mesembryanthemums the colors of the rainbow, under the fragrant Australian eucalyptus trees never previously seen in California, past the rare heathers from South Africa — excited to show them “the latest plant pet,” as one friend recalled.

She traveled up and down the California coast, searching for beautiful overlooked plants that could thrive in a drought-prone climate, which she cultivated in her nursery and shared with the community. Soon, gardeners all across Southern California were walking through their backyard wonderlands, lovingly touching their proudest plants and saying, “Kate Sessions gave me that.”
In the interlude between the two World Wars, Kate set out to learn about the world’s plants. She traveled to Hawaii and the Alps, drank in the “warm though bracing air and the wonderful blue of the Mediterranean” and admired the cypress-covered mountains of Italy “silvering with lichens on the rugged rocks,” visited the majestic gardens of Versailles and a tiny nursery on the shore of Lake Geneva, a stone’s throw from where Mary Shelley dreamt up Frankenstein. 
Kate returned from her expedition with 140 new species, among them the purple-blooming tree now so iconic of Southern California — the beloved Jacaranda mimosifolia, also known as fern tree, which for forty million springs has been gracing sub-tropical South America with its ravishing blossoms. 
Jacaranda from a French botany book, 1822. (Available as a print and as stationery cards, benefitting The Nature Conservancy.)
Throughout her life, Kate corresponded tirelessly with other horticulturalists, hosted tree-planting parties, and wrote hundreds of magazine articles and papers — notes from her foreign expeditions, reports from flower shows, meticulous growing tips for particular plants, from wisteria to Chilean jasmine. 
She never married. Her life was animated by her relationship with the Canadian horticulturalist Alice Eastwood, rooted in their shared love of flowers: “our children,” Kate told Alice, “which I am growing and you are naming.”
Kate Sessions in her 40s
When San Diego declared September 15 Kate Sessions Day, celebrating her botanical makeover of the city, she responded simply: 
I didn’t do it. It was the plants that did it.
Complement her story with that of the Victorian visionary Marianne North, who traveled the world at the risk of her life to revolutionize art and science with her botanical paintings, then revisit this centuries-wide meditation on flowers and the meaning of life and this posy of poems celebrating the delights of gardening.",,Themarginalian.org,Tree Fern,,,0.2,0.75,"Forests, Other",Other,Other,English
433,Autumn Canaday,Research identifies moths that slow the spread of invasive fern,"The invasive Old World Climbing Fern was introduced to Florida's ecosystem from southeast Asia around 1965. It soon dominated the state's native vegetation, infesting more than 100,000 acres in a short amount of time.",https://phys.org/news/2023-07-moths-invasive-fern.html,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2023/research-identifies-mo.jpg,2023-07-31T19:25:08Z,"The invasive Old World Climbing Fern was introduced to Florida's ecosystem from southeast Asia around 1965. It soon dominated the state's native vegetation, infesting more than 100,000 acres in a short amount of time.
The fern spreads quickly and has destroyed numerous native plant populations, smothering trees and shrubs with vines that can grow up to 90 feet in length. You'll now find this invasive fern throughout south and central Florida, specifically in wetlands and other habitats like the Everglades tree islands, bald cypress domes, and sawgrass prairies.
USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australian Biological Control Laboratory (ABCL), scientists began to search for a way to solve this agricultural challenge and soon found an answer to slow the fern's spread.
ARS and ABCL researchers collected, identified, and tested caterpillars feeding on the Old World climbing fern in its native habitat. One species of fern-feeding snout moth, Neomusotima conspurcatalis, commonly known as the Brown lygodium moth, is a member of the subfamily of Musotiminae and has been a successful deterrent to this invasive fern.
The Musotiminae belongs to the Crambidae family that have protruding labial palpi, or ""noses,"" giving the family the common name of ""snout moths."" Most of the moths that ARS researchers discovered in southeast Asia were snout moths, which at that time, belonged to a subfamily that had not been studied by the Agency.
""Early detection of potential invasive species is crucial so USDA can quickly implement strategies that protect U.S. agriculture, forestry, and the environment,"" said ARS researcher Alma Solis. ""This study led to the discovery of a number of new fern-feeding species and the identity of their caterpillars, which were previously unknown to science.""
ARS researchers studied the snout moth's external wing patterns, dissected its insides, specifically the genitalia and wings, and compared it to other southeast Asian moth species. All of the snout moth's immature stages, including larvae, and pupae, had never been seen before and were considered new to science. The research team also compiled a chart to compare adult and immature morphologies, host plants, and geographic distribution of the fern-feeding species.
The findings permitted ARS to create criteria for biological control workers across the globe to distinguish Musotiminae species in their own countries or eco-systems. The snout moth was later introduced to Florida and slowed the spread of the Old World Climbing Fern with their eating habits.
ARS researchers, and research partners for the state of Florida, continue to study the interactions of snout moths with parasites, predators, and fungi. Together they are working together to deter the spread of this invasive fern throughout the nation and protect America's native vegetation.

435,Carol Clark-Emory,2 common plant extracts shield cells from COVID,Extracts from the flowers of two common wild plants block the virus that causes COVID from entering human cells.,https://www.futurity.org/plant-extracts-covid-virus-2874132/,https://www.futurity.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/plant-extracts-covid-19-1600.jpg,2023-02-13T19:35:20Z,"Two common wild plants contain extracts that inhibit the ability of the virus that causes COVID-19 to infect living cells, according to a new study.
The study, published in Scientific Reports, is the first major screening of botanical extracts to search for potency against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the researchers say.
In laboratory dish tests, extracts from the flowers of tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima) and the rhizomes of the eagle fern (Pteridium aquilinum) each blocked SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells.
The active compounds are only present in miniscule quantities in the plants. It would be ineffective, and potentially dangerous, for people to attempt to treat themselves with them, the researchers stress. In fact, the eagle fern is known to be toxic, they warn.
“It’s very early in the process, but we’re working to identify, isolate, and scale up the molecules from the extracts that showed activity against the virus,” says senior author Cassandra Quave, associate professor in Emory School of Medicine’s dermatology department and the Center for the Study of Human Health. “Once we have isolated the active ingredients, we plan to further test for their safety and for their long-range potential as medicines against COVID-19.”
Medicines from plants and fungi
Quave is an ethnobotanist, studying how traditional people have used plants for medicine to identify promising new candidates for modern-day drugs. Her lab curates the Quave Natural Product Library, which contains thousands of botanical and fungal natural products extracted from plants collected at sites around the world.
Caitlin Risener, a PhD candidate in Emory’s Molecular and Systems Pharmacology graduate program and the Center for the Study of Human Health, is first author of the current paper.
In previous research to identify potential molecules for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections, the Quave lab focused on plants that traditional people had used to treat skin inflammation.
Given that COVID-19 is a newly emerged disease, the researchers took a broader approach. They devised a method to rapidly test more than 1,800 extracts and 18 compounds from the Quave Natural Product Library for activity against SARS-CoV-2.
“We’ve shown that our natural products library is a powerful tool to help search for potential therapeutics for an emerging disease,” Risener says. “Other researchers can adapt our screening method to search for other novel compounds within plants and fungi that may lead to new drugs to treat a range of pathogens.”
Plants offer COVID protection
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with a spike protein that can bind to a protein called ACE2 on host cells. “The viral spike protein uses the ACE2 protein almost like a key going into a lock, enabling the virus to break into a cell and infect it,” Quave explains.
The researchers devised experiments with virus-like particles, or VLPs, of SARS-CoV-2, and cells programmed to overexpress ACE2 on their surface. The VLPs were stripped of the genetic information needed to cause a COVID-19 infection. Instead, if a VLP managed to bind to an ACE2 protein and enter a cell, it was programmed to hijack the cell’s machinery to activate a fluorescent green protein.
The researchers added a plant extract to the cells in a Petri dish before introducing the viral particles. By shining a fluorescent light on the dish, they could quickly determine whether the viral particles had managed to enter the cells and activate the green protein.
The researchers identified a handful of hits for extracts that protected against viral entry and then homed in on the ones showing the strongest activity: Tall goldenrod and eagle fern. Both plant species are native to North America and are known for traditional medicinal uses by Native Americans.
Additional experiments showed that the protective power of the plant extracts worked across four variants of SARS-CoV-2: Alpha, Theta, Delta and Gamma.
Plants for infectious diseases
To further test these results, the Quave lab collaborated with coauthor Raymond Schinazi, professor of pediatrics, director of Emory’s Division of Laboratory of Biochemical Pharmacology, and co-director of the HIV Cure Scientific Working Group within the NIH-sponsored Emory University Center for AIDS Research. A world leader in antiviral development, Schinazi is best known for his pioneering work on breakthrough HIV drugs.
The higher biosecurity rating of the Schinazi lab enabled the researchers to test the two plant extracts in experiments using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus instead of VLPs. The results confirmed the ability of the tall goldenrod and eagle fern extracts to inhibit the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to a living cell and infect it.
“Our results set the stage for the future use of natural product libraries to find new tools or therapies against infectious diseases,” Quave says.
As a next step, the researchers are working to determine the exact mechanism that enables the two plant extracts to block binding to ACE2 proteins.
Medicinal potential
For Risener, one of the best parts about the project is that she collected samples of tall goldenrod and eagle fern herself. In addition to gathering medicinal plants from around the globe, the Quave lab also makes field trips to the forests of the Joseph W. Jones Research Center in South Georgia. The Woodruff Foundation established the center to help conserve one of the last remnants of the unique longleaf pine ecosystem that once dominated the southeastern United States.
“It’s awesome to go into nature to identify and dig up plants,” Risener says. “That’s something that few graduate students in pharmacology get to do. I’ll be covered in dirt from head to toe, kneeling on the ground, and beaming with excitement and happiness.”
She also assists in preparing the plant extracts and mounting the specimens for the Emory Herbarium. “When you collect a specimen yourself, and dry and preserve the samples, you get a personal connection,” she says. “It’s different from someone just handing you a vial of plant material in a lab and saying, ‘Analyze this.'”
After graduating, Risener hopes for a career in outreach and education for science policy surrounding research into natural compounds. A few of the more famous medicines derived from botanicals include aspirin (from the willow tree), penicillin (from fungi), and the cancer therapy Taxol (from the yew tree).
“Plants have such chemical complexity that humans probably couldn’t dream up all the botanical compounds that are waiting to be discovered,” Risener says. “The vast medicinal potential of plants highlights the importance of preserving ecosystems.”

At thirty-four, while traveling through Europe, Bailey was felled by severe neurological symptoms — the result of a mysterious viral or bacterial invasion that savaged her mitochondria, vanquishing youth’s sense of invincibility, subverting the common faith in modern medicine: In and out of hospitals as treatment after treatment failed to help, she was eventually left pinned to her bed at home, the distance to the bookshelf across the room an expedition demanding a whole day’s energies. She reflects:
Given the ease with which health infuses life with meaning and purpose, it is shocking how swiftly illness steals away those certainties.
She slips into the time-warp of illness — the way it has of making an eternity of a single moment while letting entire days vanish. Millennia after Seneca contemplated the balance of time spent, saved, and wasted and a decade before Zadie Smith considered the pandemic as a lens on time, Bailey observes:
Time unused and only endured still vanishes, as if time itself is starving, and each day is swallowed whole, leaving no crumbs, no memory, no trace at all.
And then the blur is suddenly interrupted by a peculiar gift: One day, a friend brings her a pot of violets from the nearby forest, housing a single Neohelix albolabris — a common woodland snail.

At first indignant about what she could possibly do with a bivalve pet when she can hardly sit up, Bailey grows quickly fascinated by the creature’s feeding habits, its sleep rhythms, its gentle insistence on survival. She decides to give it a proper home. In a dusty corner of the barn next to the studio where she is bedridden, her caretaker finds a discarded glass aquarium that soon becomes a lavish terrarium filled with native plants from the snail’s woodland home. 
Having once made a living as a professional gardener, Bailey takes vivifying delight in populating the tiny botanical garden, listing out plants she doesn’t know whether she will ever again see in the wild: 
Goldthread — aptly named for its colorful roots — holding its trio of delicate, paw-shaped leaves high on a thin stem; partridgeberry, with its round, dark green leaves and its small, bright red berries, which lasted for months; the larger, waxy leaves of checkerberry; many kinds of moss; small polypody ferns; a tiny spruce tree; a rotting birch log; and a piece of old bark encrusted with multicolored lichen.

Captive in her bedroom, she comes to see the snail’s home as a microcosm of existence — its terrarium an entire world, its miniature movements an ongoing odyssey, emanating what the great naturalist Henry Beston celebrated as the sacredness of smallness. In paying such tender and total attention to the snail’s life, she learns to pay attention to life itself at the focal point of the living moment, which is the only share of eternity we have. She reflects:
Survival often depends on a specific focus: a relationship, a belief, or a hope balanced on the edge of possibility. Or something more ephemeral: the way the sun passes through the hard, seemingly impenetrable glass of a window and warms the blanket, or how the wind, invisible but for its wake, is so loud one can hear it through the insulated walls of a house.
Looking in on the snail’s miniature universe, she learns to look out — out of the human-sized terrarium of her bedroom, out of the painful circumstance of her illness, out of the limiting if-only mind that tells us we need certain conditions in order to feel the majesty and mystery of life; she learns that even the smallest opening is enough for beauty and wonder to pour in, and that we make the opening with the sharpness of our attention — for attention is how we render reality what it is. 
With an eye to her widened lens of wonder, she writes:
As I window-watched, I observed the comings and goings of my neighbors; they, too, were part of the rhythm of my familiar rural landscape. They would depart for work or errands and later return, walk their dogs, cut firewood, and check their roadside mailboxes. As twilight deepened, the low dart of a nighthawk over the field would catch my eye. Darkness brought the sparking of secret codes from the mate-seeking fireflies. Then, black on black, the swift shapes of bats would swoop for late-night morsels, and the hooting of owls would come softly, softly, from the woods — until all was quiet and still beneath the ancient brightness of distant stars and the shape-shifting moon.
The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating is a benediction of a book in its entirety — the kind rapturous to read, difficult to write about.

437,,Timing plant evolution with a fast-ticking epigenetic clock,"Recent discoveries in the field of epigenetics, the study of inheritance of traits that occur without changing the DNA sequence, have shown that chronological age in mammals correlates with epigenetic changes that accumulate during the lifetime of an individual. In humans, this observation has led to the development of epigenetic clocks, which are now extensively used as biomarkers of aging. While these clocks work accurately from birth until death, they are set back to zero in each new generation. Now, an international team shows that epigenetic clocks not only exist in plants, but that these clocks keep ticking accurately over many generations.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/09/230929131649.htm,https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,2023-09-29T17:16:49Z,"Recent discoveries in the field of epigenetics, the study of inheritance of traits that occur without changing the DNA sequence, have shown that chronological age in mammals correlates with epigenetic changes that accumulate during the lifetime of an individual.In humans, this observation has led to the development of epigenetic clocks, which are now extensively used as biomarkers of aging. While these clocks work accurately from birth until death, they are set back to zero in each new generation.
Now, an international team co-led by the University of Georgia, the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and the Technical University of Munich, shows that epigenetic clocks not only exist in plants, but that these clocks keep ticking accurately over many generations. In a new study published in the journal Science, the team describes how this clock can tell time with a resolution from decades to centuries, an accuracy that cannot be achieved with traditional DNA mutation-based clocks.
The research sheds new light on microevolutionary questions that have been challenging to resolve, such as the timing of introduction of invasive species and the consequences of human activities since the emergence of modern industrialization.
""Our first hint that an epigenetic clock exists in plants was revealed when we studied how DNA methylation, a chemical modification to DNA sequence underlying many epigenetic processes, varied across numerous branches in a 300-year-old poplar tree,"" said Frank Johannes, professor of plant epigenomics at the Technical University of Munich and co-author of the study. ""We combined DNA methylation data with branch diameter and coring data to count tree rings, which reflects branch age. We were unable to core one branch, but we accurately estimated its age using only DNA methylation data, which provided the first clues there exists an epigenetic clock in plants.""
The team's research showed experimentally that epigenetic clocks recapitulate known divergence times of intra-species phylogenetic or evolutionary trees in the self-fertilizing plant A. thaliana, a small plant in the mustard family, and the clonal seagrass Z. marina, which represent two major modes of plant reproduction.
""We further strengthened the existence of a plant epigenetic clock using a variety of experimental evolution populations of A. thalianawith known pedigrees,"" said Robert Schmitz, UGA Foundation Professor in Plant Sciences, Lars G. Ljungdahl Distinguished Investigator in the department of genetics, and co-author on the study.
These plants were grown by single-seed descent for up to 32 generations from wild type exposed to different environments or from natural strains from distinct geographical origins.
""Using DNA methylome data from hundreds of individuals from throughout these populations, we identified a subset of epimutations that are 'clock-like' and accurately estimated time of the pedigree,"" said Zhilin Zhang, doctoral student from the Technical University of Munich and co-lead author on the study along with Nan Yao, a doctoral student in the UGA Franklin College of Arts and Sciences department of genetics.
""We showed this epigenetic clock was more accurate at dating a recently diverged North American population of A. thaliana, approximately 140 years old, compared to a molecular clock using DNA mutations of the same individuals,"" Yao said.
""The proposed novel molecular clock will enable us to solve a long-standing riddle,"" said Thorsten Reusch, head of marine evolutionary ecology, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel.

These customs are still alive today, and they could help address a variety of conditions. Now reporting in ACS Omega, a team of researchers have identified compounds in the leaves of a particular medicinal Labrador tea plant used throughout the First Nations of Nunavik, Canada, and demonstrated that one of them has activity against the parasite responsible for malaria.
""Labrador tea"" refers to multiple, closely related plantsall members of the genus Rhododendron. These are small, evergreen shrubs with fuzzy leaves that, as their name suggests, are steeped to make herbal teas commonly used by the Inuit and Indigenous nations in the U.S. and Canada. Reportedly, drinks made from the leaves or roots can aid in treating colds or the flu, headaches or stomach aches, nasal congestion and many other ailments.
Past studies have shown that essential oils extracted from the plants have antimicrobial properties, which could help fight antibiotic-resistant microbes. Dwarf Labrador tea, or Rhododendron subarcticum, produces a particularly aromatic brew and grows in the harsher conditions of the subarctic, found from Alaska to Siberia just south of the Arctic Circle.
Despite its common use as a traditional medicine, its chemical composition and potential antimicrobial applications remain relatively unstudied. So, Normand Voyer and colleagues wanted to characterize the makeup of R. subarcticum for the first time and test its antiparasitic activity.
The team gathered R. subarcticum leaves from Nunavik, a region in northern Quebec. The researchers extracted the essential oil from the leaves and analyzed it with gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and flame ionization detection, to identify 53 compounds. It turns out that 64.7% of the oil was comprised of ascaridole, followed by p-cymene at 21.1%. This combination of compounds has not previously been reported in closely related North American Labrador tea varieties, though it has been found in subspecies originating in Europe and Asia.
To see whether this essential oil had antimalarial properties, the team exposed two strains of Plasmodium falciparum, a malaria-causing parasite, to the oil or to just ascaridole. In the experiment, one of the strains was resistant to known antimalaria drugs. The data showed that ascaridole was the primarily component that acted against both strains of the parasite, which is consistent with other, antiparasitic traditional medicines also rich in the compound.
The researchers say that this work bolsters the importance of investigating and protecting plants used in traditional medicines, especially those from harsher climates impacted by climate change.

However, several people in the comment section pointed out that it can also be found in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu Kashmir. But, which flower is it? It’s Buransh or rhododendron!
In the video, Bhagyashree shared that buransh flowers have many medicinal benefits. “They are anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant,” she said, adding that they contain quercetin, flavonoids, vitamin C, phosphorous, calcium and iron.
The actor said that these flowers are excellent for your heart, liver and skin. But, how to consume them? “These flowers are made into a juice,” she said, sharing a simple method to extract the benefits of the buransh flowers.
*Take 1/3 of the flower extract in 2/3 water.*Boil for 20 minutes.*Allow to cool, strain, and drink immediately.
“The local markets in Uttarakhandalso sell packaged juice but that does have sugar,” Bhagyashree wrote.
 Buransh flowers have several health benefits (Source: Pixabay)Adding, Nmami Agarwal, a nutritionist, said that buransh flowers are treasure troves of phytochemicals. “Buransh, in the Himalayas, are so widely used in alternative medicines for their antifungal, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties, especially the Buransh honey. The leaves of this flower have potent astringent properties that help cure headaches, and stomach aches,” she said.
The expert added that this flower is rich in antioxidants and, therefore, very good for cardiac health, too. Buransh has a very strong relationship with diabetes and cholesterol and has medical proof also for lowering blood sugar and cholesterol naturally. “The phytochemicals present are saponin, flavonoid, and tannins amongst others and they are known to be the most powerful anti-inflammatory flowers. One of the most surprising benefits is they prevent cancer and are highly anti-ageing,” Agarwal said.

Finish spring-planting projects, postponing longer-term ones until September, if you can. Sow warm-weather vegetable seeds such as corn, squash, and beans. Plant tomato, melon, squash, cucumber, pepper, and eggplant transplants. Plant tomatoes labeled as indeterminate in tomato cages. Tomatoes labeled determinate usually do not need staking. Buy and plant flowering annuals while the selection is good. Plant tropical bulbs such as dahlias and cannas. Stake taller, weaker perennials like delphiniums and peonies, or cut them for bouquets of the broken if you forget. Cut flowers with clashing colors, too, until your garden looks the way you want, and make flower arrangements from the discards. Diligently weed invasive species before they go to seed. Pull out spent one-time tulip bulbs by the stalks, but leave the foliage of more enduring daffodils to feed rebloom next year. Buy or plant container gardens. Take houseplants outdoors to a shady spot for a few days before moving them later into more sun. Water potted plants daily in hot weather.
Q. I have 12-foot rhododendrons. Last years drought caused a lot of dead branches. Should I cut them back now?
J.C., Newburyport
A. Yes. My garden has never had so much dieback. The tops of most of my roses are dead, but new canes are sprouting from the base. Many readers wrote that their forsythias failed to bloom, though they did leaf out. In addition to the drought, I think the biggest problem was the sudden one-night temperature drop to below zero that burst so many houses pipes in February during an otherwise mild winter. When you prune, cut leafless branches all the way back to a fork flush with another branch that has leaves. Dont create stubs. Roses will often sprout new canes at the base, but rhododendrons wont do this. Minimize fertilizing, but mulch and keep the newly pruned plants regularly watered.
Q. A friend let me dig up five Eastern white pines and four hemlocks from his woods for transplanting to my yard. They range from 5 to 10 feet tall. Assuming theres no rain, how often should I water them? If they die, what types of trees would you replace them with that dont need watering?
D.L., Milton
A. It is better to transplant trees in September, or else you will have to water them deeply and weekly through their first June, July, and August, when it almost certainly will not rain enough. In fact, new trees need daily watering their first entire month. Native trees that dont need a lot of water after their second year include thornless honeylocusts, Northern catalpas, Northern red oaks, black oaks, hackberrys, Kentucky coffee trees, and hornbeams. Buy an inexpensive, circular plastic tree-watering bag and fill it weekly from a hose for the first 90 days, then discard it when it wears out. The bags save time and money because the water seeps out slowly toward the roots instead of running off. Incidentally, digging up a tree is no joke, because the roots can easily weigh 200 pounds, attached soil included. Its usually a two-person job, so I dig trees less than 5 feet tall for transplanting because the roots are lighter. If they survive, they will make up time by growing faster than larger specimens.
